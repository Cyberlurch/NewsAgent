This Project is about a NewsAgent that collects information from different sources, like YouTube and later on even other sources, like Telegram channels, websites and RSS feeds and X/Twitter.
The agent scrapes the sources and transcribes the content Before summarizing them.
the aim is even to translate the content from the original English to german and later on even Swedish and polish.
Then, the agent mails out the finished newsletter to the recipients.
the summaries have to be meaningful but at the same time not too lengthy. a range, depending on the content between 250-700 Words for each summary should be a good flexible aim, menaning that the whole newsletter will contain a number of these summaries.
the Project is for fun, private and no-cost. that means only free solutions for API-keys and the like.
the coding is done in Python 3.12 for compatibility reasons of certain modules. the work is done on a windows machine, but the end-goal is to install a final working version on a raspberry pi and let it run during nighttime on a Daily basis to email out the reports being available in the morning.
the root directory is Always D:\Dropbox\Eigene Dateien\AI\NewsAgent_V2
the main variables are kept in the .env file.a venv is created and windows powershell 7 is used for commands.
the tree structure is seen in the tree.txt file. 
the agent is modular with 

D:\Dropbox\Eigene Dateien\AI\NewsAgent_V2\src\newsagent\main.py as main script.
collectors in D:\Dropbox\Eigene Dateien\AI\NewsAgent_V2\src\newsagent\collectors:
youtube_collector.py
utilities in D:\Dropbox\Eigene Dateien\AI\NewsAgent_V2\src\newsagent\utils, like:
email_sender, groq_summarizer, report_writer, translator
reports should land here:
D:\Dropbox\Eigene Dateien\AI\NewsAgent_V2\reports
the scraped data is cached here: D:\Dropbox\Eigene Dateien\AI\NewsAgent_V2\src\cache or here D:\Dropbox\Eigene Dateien\AI\NewsAgent_V2\.cache
data like channels.json is located here: D:\Dropbox\Eigene Dateien\AI\NewsAgent_V2\data

the goal is to optimize the Project by making it stable and the output meaningful. 
if these goals are met, more functionality can be added.

when doing troubleshooting or iterations, ask for what information you need from me to continue efficiently.
when responding, do it Always with complete drop-in ready scripts, not snippets to avoid errors.
do not change structure, variables or folder or file locations. If necessary to do that, discuss these planned Changes in advanve to ensure stability during troubleshooting.
