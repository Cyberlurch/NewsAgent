## PREPAREDNESS

### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The speaker, a prepper, reflects on mistakes they have made in their prepping journey. One major mistake is prioritizing iconography over obscurity. They believe that having a plain, grayman truck would be more effective for a prepper than a flashy, decked-out truck that stands out. They recommend getting a diesel vehicle, which is more practical and can store fuel, instead of opting for an electric vehicle. The speaker also notes that diesel vehicles are being phased out, which may be due to their empowering nature.
Another mistake the speaker made is rushing into decisions and not taking a more realistic approach. They predict that things will happen quickly, but the reality is that they happen on a much slower timeline. This has led to them making costly mistakes and not optimizing their decisions as much as they could have.
The speaker also advises against believing in the off-grid myth, which is the idea that being off-grid will be a simple and free way of living. They state that it is a lot of work and that freedom does not always equate to simplicity. They recommend buying a plot of land in a remote area, even if it is not the best, as it will likely increase in value after a disaster.
The speaker highlights the importance of skills, not just gear, for a prepper. They believe that taking courses in survival and first aid would be beneficial and that having a skilled trade would be valuable in a post-disaster scenario.
Finally, the speaker warns against having too much gear and not being organized. They believe that it is better to have a few high-quality, reliable tools and to master them, rather than having a lot of mediocre gear. They also recommend having a system of organizing gear and using one brand for all tools and equipment to simplify things.
Overall, the speaker's mistakes as a prepper are based on prioritizing appearance over functionality, rushing into decisions, believing in unrealistic expectations, and not focusing enough on skills and organization. They offer advice on how to avoid these mistakes and create a more effective and sustainable prepping strategy.
Some key takeaways from the transcript include:
* Prioritizing obscurity over iconography
* Buying a diesel vehicle and storing fuel
* Being more realistic about the timeline of disasters and fallout
* Not believing in the off-grid myth
* Focusing on skills and organization
* Having a limited number of high-quality, reliable tools and mastering them
* Using one brand for all tools and equipment to simplify organization



### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

The analyst discusses three major stories related to geopolitics and disaster preparedness. The first story pertains to the supposed rift between the Pentagon and the Israeli military, with the analyst stating that the flow of weapons is key to understanding the truth in geopolitics.
The second story focuses on the increasing hostility and tension between Germany and Russia, with Germany recently stating that all restrictions on the use of NATO weaponry have been lifted on Ukraine. The analyst notes that Russia has threatened direct strikes on NATO assets if this happens and that Germany is attempting to enable Ukrainian missile capabilities, which could potentially bypass Russian air defenses.
The third story involves a confirmed leak of blueprints of Russia's secret nuclear bases, which exposes grave implications for Russia's cybersecurity infrastructure. The analyst notes that Russia is already in a disadvantageous situation in terms of full-blown nuclear war due to NATO's surrounding of Russia and the use of Ukrainian drone strikes to gather data on Russia's missile defense capabilities.
The analyst highlights the significance of the leak, which includes 2 million documents exposing Russia's nuclear program, including blueprints, security details, and layout plans of missile silos, bunkers, and tunnel systems. The leak could potentially provide NATO with an edge in a full-blown nuclear war, but the analyst notes that the specifics of the inards of a bunker may not be as crucial.
The analyst discusses the possibility of the leak being intentional, citing historical precedents of Russia leaking misleading information to throw NATO off the scent. They also note that the leak could be a form of subtrafuge and misdirection, potentially targeting internal rivals or boosting Putin's image.
The analyst presents arguments against the leak being intentional, citing the 2 million documents and sensitive details, which are falsifiable and would allow Western intelligence to fact-check the information. They also note that the leak may be a propaganda exercise or psychological operation, revealing that Western intelligence has access to this information.
The key point to take away from this story is that the leaks reveal Russia's major nuclear upgrades and expose vulnerabilities that could potentially contribute to war planners seeking a first nuclear strike. The more information like this that is leaked, the more Russia has its back up against the wall.
Overall, the analyst highlights the significance of the leak and its potential implications for the global balance of power, emphasizing the importance of understanding the flow of weapons and information in geopolitics.

### [‚ö†Ô∏è Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyoljrgDJY)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The speaker begins by stating that investors are selling US government bonds at an unprecedented rate, leading to a rise in gold and silver prices. He notes that this trend is not unique to the US dollar, but is instead a global phenomenon affecting most fiat currencies.
The speaker highlights the "sell America" trend, where investors are liquidating their US government bond holdings due to concerns about the country's debt and creditworthiness. This has led to a higher interest rate on 30-year US treasury bonds, reaching above 5% for the first time in several years.
The speaker warns that this could have serious consequences for the US economy, including higher debt servicing costs, inflation, and potentially even hyperinflation. He notes that the US debt is already over $22 trillion and could reach $50 trillion by the end of the decade if interest rates continue to rise.
The speaker attributes the rise in gold and silver prices to the declining purchasing power of fiat currencies, which are experiencing a "death spiral" of debt and inflation. He notes that the trend is global, affecting not just the US dollar but also other major currencies.
The speaker also discusses the impact of the recent downgrading of the US credit rating by Moody's to Aa3 from Aaa, citing concerns about the country's debt and economic outlook. He notes that this could lead to a further decline in the value of the US dollar and potentially even the introduction of a new currency or digital currency.
The speaker emphasizes the importance of having a diversified portfolio and considering alternative assets such as gold, silver, and Bitcoin. He notes that these assets have historically performed well during times of economic uncertainty and are likely to do so again.
The speaker concludes by offering a 90% discount on his new investment programs, which focus on gold and silver investing, and invites listeners to join him on a free video series that will be released over the coming weeks.
Overall, the speaker's message is one of caution and preparation, urging investors to take action to protect their assets and navigate the uncertain landscape of global economics.
