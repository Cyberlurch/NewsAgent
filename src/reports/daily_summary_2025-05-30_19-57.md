## PREPAREDNESS

### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The speaker shares their personal experiences and mistakes as a prepper, emphasizing the importance of being a Greyman, blending in, and avoiding iconography. They regret decking out their truck with bells and whistles, instead opting for a plain, grey, inconspicuous vehicle with a hidden winch. Diesel vehicles are recommended due to their ability to store diesel fuel, which is less volatile and can be used for various equipment.
Another lesson learned is the importance of being realistic about the timeline of events. The speaker notes that they have made accurate predictions, but calculations were incorrect, leading to rushing into decisions. They highlight the example of the pandemic, which took longer than expected, and World War II, which is ongoing, but occurring at a slower pace.
The speaker advises against off-grid living, citing the misconception that it will be simpler. They emphasize the need for diesel infrastructure, fuel storage, and power lines, and recommend buying land in areas that are unappealing to most people but offer value in the midst of a crisis.
The speaker's third lesson is the importance of focusing on skills, instead of relying on gear. They acknowledge their own mistakes in this regard, having been too proud to take advice from others, and not pursuing courses in survival, first aid, and other essential skills. Having a skilled trade and being organized are also essential for preppers.
Lastly, the speaker cautions against having too much gear and not being organized. They illustrate this point by mentioning gun collectors who never master one gun, instead accumulating a large collection. They recommend finding one satisfactory tool for every aspect of prepping and mastering it.
In the conclusion, the speaker invites viewers to share their own mistakes as preppers in the comments section. They also promote their online store, CanadianPreparedness.com, and offer a discount code for subscribers.



### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

The host of the Prepper News Channel provides an update on current world events, focusing on three major stories: the supposed rift between the Pentagon and Israeli military, tensions between Germany and Russia, and the leak of blueprints of Russia's secret nuclear bases.
Regarding the rift between the Pentagon and Israeli military, the host suggests that Israel is being enabled to engage in a full-on conflict with Iran, with ongoing weapon shipments. He notes that this development could indicate a significant shift in geopolitics, with the weapons flow serving as a proxy for the truth.
The second story pertains to the increasing hostility between Germany and Russia. The host explains that Germany has been enabling Ukraine to construct its own long-range missile systems, which could potentially reach 2,000 kilometers into Russia. Russia has threatened to strike NATO assets, including Brussels and German targets, if this happens. Germany is trying to circumvent this issue by empowering Ukraine to construct the missile systems within its own country. The host notes that Israel has been heavily targeting these facilities, and rumors suggest that Russia has been targeting these facilities as well.
The third story involves the leak of blueprints of Russia's secret nuclear bases, which were made available online. The leak included 2 million documents, exposing Russia's nuclear program. The host notes that this leak has significant implications for Russia's cyber security infrastructure and could potentially give NATO an advantage in a full-on war with Russia.
The host questions whether this leak was intentional or due to bureaucratic oversight. He notes that Russia has done this before, using leaks as a form of misdirection or subterfuge. The leak could have been used to focus NATO's attention on specific facilities while the real bunkers are located elsewhere. He also speculates that the leak may have been intended to boost Putin's image or target internal rivals.
The host argues that the leak may not be as damaging as initially thought, as some of the information is already publicly available, and European subsidiary companies have worked on designing devices and systems used in Russian nuclear bunkers. He notes that the Russians are being tight-lipped about the leak and that it is difficult to say what the impact will be.
The host concludes that the key point to take away is that the leaks reveal Russia's major nuclear upgrades and expose vulnerabilities that could contribute to war planning. He notes that the more information that is leaked, the more Russia is pushed into a corner, and the more likely it is to respond with a first nuclear strike.

### [‚ö†Ô∏è Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyoljrgDJY)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The speaker is warning of an impending financial crisis, citing the rising price of gold and the sale of US government bonds. He mentions a trend called "Cell America" where investors are dumping bonds in response to the US government's increasing debt. This has led to a higher interest rate on 30-year treasuries, causing concern for the global financial system. The speaker believes that this is part of a larger debt spiral, where the weakening of fiat currencies, such as the US dollar, is causing a rise in gold prices.
The speaker notes that Moody's downgraded the US from a AAA rating to a lower level, which has caused concern globally. He believes that the US government's increasing debt, with estimates of an additional $3.5 to $20 trillion over the next 10 years, will make it difficult to service the debt.
The speaker emphasizes the importance of physical assets and diversification in protecting one's wealth. He recommends tangible assets, such as gold and silver, and notes that Bitcoin has a space in portfolios. He believes that a central bank digital currency (CBDC) is being prepared and that the US government may eventually put the country onto a gold standard or a combination of assets including gold, bitcoin, and others.
The speaker also mentions the credit rating agencies, noting that they have not changed their behavior from the 2008 financial crisis. He believes that the downgrade of US equities is a sign of a new period in the global financial system.
To protect oneself from the impending crisis, the speaker advises investing in physical assets, being well-diversified, and looking ahead at historical patterns. He recommends his new investment courses on gold and silver, which focus on teaching investors how to buy, store, and diversify their assets.
The speaker also mentions the increasing authoritarianism in the Euro zone and the plans for a European army. He notes that the charts for gold and silver prices versus the US dollar and other currencies are almost completely inverted, indicating that gold and silver may continue to rise as the value of fiat currencies falls.
Finally, the speaker offers a 90% discount on his new investment courses, stating that they are still being filmed and will be released gradually over the next few weekends. He also offers two free bonuses: a video module and PDF downloads.
The speaker's overall message is one of alarm and warning, urging investors to take action to protect their wealth before it's too late.
