**Gardening Expert Visits Prepper's Garden**

Gardening in Canada: Hey everyone, it's your favourite gardening expert, Gardening in Canada. I'm here today to assess the prepper's garden and provide some guidance on how to improve it. Let's get started!

Prepper: Thanks, Gardening in Canada! I'm excited to show you around my garden and learn from your expertise.

**Gardening Techniques**

Gardening in Canada: Okay, let's start with the basics. Proper gardening techniques are essential for a successful harvest. Make sure to space your plants correctly and use irrigation systems to keep them well-watered. This will help reduce waste and ensure a consistent food supply.

Prepper: That makes sense. I've been trying to figure out the right spacing and irrigation for my plants. Can you give me some specific advice?

Gardening in Canada: For example, peppers need to be spaced about 12 inches apart and watered regularly. You can also use flowers to attract pollinators and improve yields. Tomatoes, on the other hand, need proper support, like cages or trellises, and regular pruning to promote healthy growth.

**Greenhouse Challenges**

Gardening in Canada: I see you have a greenhouse. That's great! However, temperature control and pest management can be challenging in a greenhouse. Make sure to regulate the temperature and use natural methods to control pests, such as introducing beneficial insects.

Prepper: Yeah, I've been struggling with aphids and other pests. Do you have any advice on how to deal with them?

Gardening in Canada: Yes, for aphids, you can introduce ladybugs or lacewings, which will feed on them naturally. You can also use neem oil or insecticidal soap to control pest populations.

**Efficient Gardening**

Gardening in Canada: Another important aspect of gardening is maximizing space and efficiency. Using raised beds and trellising can help you grow more plants in the same area.

Prepper: That's a great idea. I've been thinking about using raised beds, but I'm not sure how to get started.

Gardening in Canada: It's actually quite simple. Just use a level to ensure the bed is even, fill it with high-quality soil, and plant your chosen crops.

**Soil Quality and Preparation**

Gardening in Canada: When it comes to soil quality, it's essential to use high-quality soil and properly prepare it for planting. This includes testing the pH level and incorporating organic matter, like compost, to improve the soil's structure and fertility.

Prepper: I'll definitely check the pH level of my soil. What about irrigation systems? Do you have any advice on how to design them?

Gardening in Canada: Yes, a well-designed irrigation system is crucial for efficient water use. Consider using direct drippers and sprayers to reduce waste and promote healthy plant growth.

**Crop Selection**

Gardening in Canada: When selecting crops, it's essential to choose ones that are well-suited to the local climate and growing conditions. This will help ensure a successful harvest and promote sustainability.

Prepper: That makes sense. How do I determine which crops are best for my area?

Gardening in Canada: Research the USDA Hardiness Zone Map to determine your area's hardiness zone. This will give you an idea of which crops are suitable for your region. For example, you're in Zone 3, but your greenhouse is in a microclimate that's similar to Zone 4 or 5. You can use this information to select crops that thrive in those conditions.

**Expert Guidance**

Gardening in Canada: As a gardener, it's essential to take the time to learn and practice your skills. Don't be afraid to ask for help or seek out expert guidance. There's a wealth of knowledge available online, and I'm happy to provide you with advice and support.

Prepper: Thanks, Gardening in Canada! Your expertise has been invaluable. I feel much more confident now that I can improve my garden and prepare for the future.

Gardening in Canada: That's what it's all about – being prepared for a potential apocalypse and promoting long-term sustainability. Keep up the good work, and remember to stay tuned for more gardening tips and advice on my YouTube channel, which has over 1.33 million subscribers!

**Rating System**

Gardening in Canada: As I was assessing your garden, I gave your onion plants a rating of 10 out of 10. They were healthy and well-grown!

Prepper: Thanks for the feedback! I'll make sure to take your advice and continue improving my garden.

Gardening in Canada: Remember, practice makes perfect. Keep learning, experimenting, and adjusting your gardening methods as needed. Good luck, and happy gardening!

[[REACTION]  Gaza : 'The medical system - has been systematically dismantled']
Judging Freedom

Dr Fose Sidwa, en amerikansk traumatiker och intensivvårdsskötare från Stockton, Kalifornien, har vittnat inför säkerhetsrådet i New York om sina erfarenheter av att volontärarbetat i Gaza Stråket. Väsentliga punkter från hans vittnesmål inkluderar:

* Han har volontärarbetat i Gaza två gånger sedan 7 oktober och hans patienter bestod främst av civila, inklusive sexåringar och gravida kvinnor som hade skadats av sprängdeg, skottgluggar och andra former av våld.
* Under hans fem veckor i Gaza såg han inte eller behandlade en enda stridande, vilket understryker den oproportionerliga påverkan av konflikten på civila.
* Mediacystemet i Gaza har "systematiskt demolerats" genom en genomdriven militär kampanj som har åsidosatt internationell humanitär lag.
* Konsekvenserna av denna kampanj är allvarliga, med civila som dör från akut undernäring, sårinfektion, exponering och förtvivlan, i tillägg till direktskador från bombningar.
* Dr Sidwa betonade att detta är en "mänsklig katastrof" som helt och hållet är förebyggbar, och att deltaga i eller tillåta det att hända är en valfrihet.
* Han noterade också att förhindra folkmord kräver att vägra normalisera dessa övergrepp och vägra dehumanisera palestinier.
* Konflikten har lett till en "krissituation i människovärdesmässig mening" med hela en folkgrupp på randen till överlevnad, och Dr. Sidwa uppmuntrade att det enda sättet att tillmötesgå detta är att erkänna palestiniernas mänsklighet och vägra se dem som endast statistik eller föremål.

Situationen i Gaza har stödd av Sverige, som en del av det större internationella samfundet och med stöd från Sverige har den situation som har utvecklat sig. USA har också stödjer det. Detta har lett till kritik som Sverige är en del av en makt som är ansvarig för att Israel utför dessa handlingar.
