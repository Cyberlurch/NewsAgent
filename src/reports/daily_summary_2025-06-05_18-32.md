### [ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ALERT: All Travel STOPPED- Watchmen Updates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhudY0YdyPU)
*The Poplar Report*  

The recent updates include a travel ban announced by President Trump on 12 countries, which will go into effect on Monday. The countries affected are:
* Afghanistan
* Burma
* Chad
* Republic of the Congo
* Equatoria
* Equatorial Guinea
* Eritrea
* Haiti
* Iran
* Libya
* Somalia
* Sudan
* Yemen
Additionally, there are partially restricted countries that have been added to the list, including:
* Burandi
* Cuba
* Laos
* S Sierra
* Leon
* Togo
* Turkmenistan
* Venezuela
The justification for the travel ban is different from the previous one, and it is expected to hold up better in court. The ban was spurred by the Colorado attack and the high rate of visa overstaying by citizens of these countries.
There is also a bioterrorism attack on the USA that has been thwarted. Two Chinese nationals were charged with smuggling a toxic fungus into the United States, which can devastate crops. They had discussed smuggling other biological agents into the country and had a signed pledge to the Chinese Communist Party.
Elon Musk has sparked a civil war in the Republican party by criticizing the big spending bill, which adds trillions of dollars to the US deficit. Musk stated that bankrupting America is not okay, and many people agree with him. The bill is seen as wasteful and will create more debt in the United States.
President Trump has admitted that the US was not warned about the attack on the Russian air bases that wiped out a third of Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Trump had a 1.5-hour phone call with President Putin to discuss peace, but it does not look like there will be peace anytime soon. Putin is expected to order a retaliatory strike, and US embassies in Ukraine have warned US citizens to take cover.
Iran has refused a deal and will continue to enrich uranium, which raises concerns about the possibility of war. The US nuclear proposal was dismissed by Iran's leader, and the country will continue its nuclear program.
The senior crisis in the United States is unfolding, with a new senior facility in northern Nevada being built but unable to hire enough nurses to staff it. Many homes are being built, and thousands of boomers are moving to the area, but there is a waiting list for meals on wheels, and the facility is still empty.
Some key statistics and numbers mentioned in the updates include:
* 12 countries affected by the travel ban
* 1.5-hour phone call between President Trump and President Putin
* 2 Chinese nationals charged with smuggling a toxic fungus
* 6 million birds culled due to the mass culling at Hickman's eggs
* 2.5 years to clean and build the flocks back up
* 30% filler material in ground coffee
The updates also mention the economic situation in the United States, with many people struggling to make ends meet. The stock market may be going up, but with inflation, people's wages have gone down. The production of the United States has gone down, and the GDP of the US has also decreased.
Some viewers have shared their personal experiences, including:
* Linda, who worked at Lowe's and saw a person loading a trailer full of mulch without paying
* Kathy, who went to Walmart and found empty shelves and low stock of food
* Scott, who had trouble finding an auto shop to do automotive repairs
* Denise, who is concerned about the senior crisis in her area and the lack of care for aging people
* Ty, who is a truck driver and is concerned about the impact of autonomous trucks on his job
* E-hyde, who noticed a big change in the price of jalapeno starts from the Amish, from $5 to $10
* Warden, who went to Lowe's and saw a mostly empty pro parking area, indicating a decrease in demand for housing and construction

Overall, the updates paint a picture of a complex and challenging time in the United States, with concerns about national security, economic stability, and social welfare.



### [Time To Get Your House In Order As The Middle Class Is Being â€˜Systemically Implodedâ€™](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPoNbpWe2Iw)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The current economic situation is characterized by a collapsing middle class, with the rich getting richer and the poor becoming destitute. Homelessness is on the rise, with many people living in tents or cars. Jobs are being collapsed or taken over by AI, and pensions are being used to support government debt, particularly in Europe and the UK. The bond market is unstable, with governments struggling to sell long-term debts. 
Key statistics and trends include:
* Gold prices have increased by 40% in a single year
* Bitcoin has increased by over 50% in a single year
* The S&P and other stock markets have shown marginal growth
* The true unemployment rate in the US is estimated to be around 24%, compared to the officially reported 4.2%
* 25% of working-age Americans are unable to find full-time work, stuck in poverty-wage jobs, or not earning enough to survive
* The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index has dropped to 50.8, the second-lowest reading in history
The current economic cycle, which has been in place since the end of World War II, is coming to an end. This cycle is characterized as a fiat system, which is unsustainable and cannot be fixed. The consequences of this collapse are far-reaching, with many people struggling to make ends meet.
One example of this struggle is a man named John, who wrote to the speaker about his difficulties. John is 37 years old, lives in his van, and works as a carpenter, earning around $17,000 per year. He has been struggling to make ends meet, particularly after his tools were stolen and he was unable to get help from the police. The speaker was able to help John by providing him with a new set of tools and access to a cash flow program.
The speaker emphasizes that the current economic situation is not a result of any particular politician or party, but rather a systemic issue. The rules of doing business are changing daily, making it difficult for businesses to operate. The UK government's taxation policies are killing jobs, with a 10% drop in job openings in just one month.
The trade war between the US and China is also having a significant impact on the economy. The US has imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, which has led to a decline in imports. In April, US imports collapsed by $68.4 billion, the largest monthly decline in American history. The trade war is causing uncertainty and instability, making it difficult for businesses to plan for the future.
The speaker suggests that individuals can take steps to protect themselves from the economic downturn. This includes:
* Getting educated and increasing income through programs such as the cash flow program
* Protecting savings and investments through programs such as the gold and silver program
* Focusing on personal growth and security
* Taking advantage of opportunities to increase income and build wealth
Overall, the speaker emphasizes that individuals have the power to take control of their financial situation, even in the face of economic uncertainty. By taking proactive steps to educate themselves, increase their income, and protect their savings, individuals can build a more secure financial future. 
Some key points to consider:
* The cash flow program can help individuals increase their income and build wealth
* The gold and silver program can help individuals protect their savings and investments
* There are 11 programs available to help individuals achieve their financial goals
* A 30-day money-back guarantee is available for those who are not satisfied with the programs
* The speaker encourages individuals to take action and start building a more secure financial future. 
In terms of next steps, the speaker suggests that individuals should:
* Take advantage of the programs and resources available to them
* Focus on building multiple streams of income
* Protect their savings and investments
* Stay informed about the current economic situation and adapt to changes as needed. 
By following these steps, individuals can build a more secure financial future and protect themselves from the economic downturn. The speaker emphasizes that it is never too late to start taking control of one's financial situation and that there are always opportunities available to build wealth and achieve financial freedom. 
Some of the key statistics and trends mentioned in the transcript include:
* The median household income has not kept pace with inflation
* The cost of living has increased significantly, with basic food products rising by as much as 50% in the last few years
* The trade war between the US and China is having a significant impact on the global economy
* The bond market is unstable, with governments struggling to sell long-term debts
* The true unemployment rate is estimated to be around 24%, compared to the officially reported 4.2%. 
These statistics and trends highlight the need for individuals to take proactive steps to protect their financial well-being and build a more secure financial future. By staying informed and adapting to changes in the economy, individuals can navigate the challenges of the current economic situation and achieve financial freedom. 
In conclusion, the current economic situation is characterized by a collapsing middle class, rising homelessness, and instability in the bond market. The true unemployment rate is estimated to be around 24%, and individuals are struggling to make ends meet. However, by taking proactive steps to educate themselves, increase their income, and protect their savings, individuals can build a more secure financial future and achieve financial freedom. The speaker emphasizes the importance of staying informed and adapting to changes in the economy, and encourages individuals to take advantage of the programs and resources available to them.

### [Explore the Bible: Read Your Bible to Understand It (Part II)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEzCXQ_8rU4)
*Behold Israel*  

Air Tati introduces Dr. Rick Yon, and they begin a new episode of "Explore the Bible." They discuss the importance of observing the Bible, specifically John 1:12, to learn how to read and understand the Bible. Dr. Rick Yon starts by praying for guidance from God to open their eyes to understand the scriptures. They begin by discussing John 1:12, which says, "But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in his name." 
* The key observation from John 1:12 is that it starts with the word "but," which indicates a contrast to what was previously stated. 
* Dr. Yon notes that the word "but" is used over 2400 times in the Bible, often to contrast what came before.
* They analyze the verse to understand what it means to receive and believe in Jesus, which is the key to becoming children of God. 
* They establish that Jesus is the one being referred to in the verse, and that he is the Word who was in the beginning with God. 
* Dr. Yon and Air Tati discuss the significance of receiving Jesus as the key to becoming children of God and being born again.
* They also examine the context of John 1:12 by looking at the preceding verses, particularly verse 1-11, to understand who Jesus is and what it means to believe in him. 
* The discussion includes John 1:14, which says that "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us," which further explains who Jesus is.
* Air Tati shares his personal experience of being a Jew who came to believe in Jesus and how it changed his life. 
* They then move on to John 3:16, where Jesus speaks with Nicodemus and explains the concept of being born again through faith.
* Jesus explains to Nicodemus that one must be born again to enter the kingdom of God, and that this birth is of the Spirit, not of the flesh. 
* Dr. Yon notes that this conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus is in response to Nicodemus' initial statement that Jesus is a teacher from God, as evidenced by his signs. 
* They analyze Jesus' response, particularly how he uses the story of Moses lifting the serpent in the wilderness as an example of how God saves people through faith. 
* The conversation also covers the story in Numbers 21:4-9, where the Israelites are bitten by snakes and God tells Moses to make a bronze serpent to save the people if they look at it, illustrating the concept of faith.
* Dr. Yon and Air Tati discuss the relevance of this passage from Numbers to the message of salvation in John 3:16, and how looking up to the serpent represents looking to Jesus for salvation. 
* They conclude that to believe is to receive Jesus as one's savior and to have simple faith in him.
The program aims to teach people how to read and understand the Bible by making observations, asking questions like "who", "what", "where", "why", and "what then". They emphasize that believing means to receive Jesus into one's life, and that it is an active part on the believer's side, not something that can be done without a conscious decision to receive Jesus as savior. 
Key points: 
* The program encourages viewers to ask questions when reading the Bible.
* They emphasize the importance of faith and receiving Jesus as the key to salvation and becoming born again. 
* Air Tati and Dr. Yon highlight the significance of Jesus' words in John 1:12 and John 3:16, explaining what it means to believe and receive Jesus. 
* The episode includes the conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus in John 3, and how Jesus uses the example of Moses and the serpent to explain salvation through faith.
* They provide examples of faith, including Numbers 21:4-9, and illustrate that salvation is a gift and a promise from God. 
* Dr. Yon emphasizes that Jesus is the Word of God who became flesh, as stated in John 1:1-14. 
Some additional key points from the conversation include: 
* Dr. Rick Yon starts with a prayer to ask God to open their eyes to understand the scriptures.
* Air Tati mentions that he is from the tribe of Judah, and that as a Jew, he was one of those who did not initially receive Jesus, but then received him and became a child of God.
* The hosts highlight that it is God's will for people to be born of God and that it requires an active decision to receive Jesus to be born again.
* Dr. Yon emphasizes the importance of reading the Bible to understand the heart of God.
* The hosts discuss how people often misunderstand what it means to believe in God, and that it requires a faith that is demonstrated through actions, as demonstrated by receiving Jesus into one's life.
* Air Tati explains that people often think that by being born into a certain religious group, they are automatically saved, but Jesus clarifies that one must be born again through faith.
* Both Air Tati and Dr. Rick Yon provide insight into how to understand the Bible by making observations, asking questions, and using biblical context to grasp the meaning of scripture. 
They close by encouraging listeners to reflect on whether they have received Jesus and if their faith is based on simple trust in him. They also mention that their website, Behold Israel, contains resources for exploring the Bible and understanding God's word, including a section where viewers can ask Dr. Yon questions.

*Redacted*  

President Trump is pushing to pass a big spending bill by July 4th, but is facing opposition from some Republicans and Elon Musk, the head of Doge. Musk recently posted on social media, calling the bill a "massive, outrageous, pork-filled congressional spending bill" and a "disgusting abomination."

* The bill is not a great solution, but it may be better than doing nothing, which would result in significant tax increases on the middle class
* The Republicans in Congress are facing opposition from Democrats, who will give them no help on anything, forcing them to use reconciliation and recisions to get things done
* There are potential cuts that can be made to the bill, including:
  + Tightening restrictions on entitlement programs and welfare programs to reduce abuse and corruption
  + Reducing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which is seen as a handout to high-income individuals in high-tax municipalities
* The bill does not intend to get rid of Medicaid, but rather introduces stricter requirements to receive it, which would remove illegal aliens from the program
Some of the key numbers mentioned in the discussion include:
* $36.2 trillion: the current national debt
* $38 trillion: the expected national debt by September
* $4.5 trillion: the expected tax increase on the middle class over 10 years if nothing is done
* 10 years: the budget window for the bill
* 10 seconds: the time given for a final word from EJ Antony
Overall, the discussion highlights the concerns about the spending bill and its potential impact on the national debt and taxes. It also highlights the opposition from some Republicans and Elon Musk, and the potential cuts that can be made to the bill.



### [[REACTION]  Gaza : 'The medical system - has been systematically dismantled'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsmiSh7dRh8)
*Judging Freedom*  

Dr. Fose Sidwa, an American trauma and critical care surgeon from Stockton, California, testified before the Security Council about his experiences volunteering in the Gaza Strip. Key points from his testimony include:
* He has volunteered in Gaza twice since October 7th, and has also volunteered in other conflict zones such as Haiti and Ukraine.
* During his 5 weeks in Gaza, he did not treat a single combatant, but instead treated civilian patients, including:
  + Six-year-olds with shrapnel in their hearts and bullets in their brains.
  + Pregnant women whose pelvises had been obliterated and their fetuses cut in two while still in the womb.
* Dr. Sidwa stated that the medical system in Gaza has not failed, but has been systematically dismantled through a sustained military campaign that has willfully violated international humanitarian law.
* He emphasized that civilians are dying not just from air strikes, but also from:
  + Acute malnutrition.
  + Sepsis.
  + Exposure.
  + Despair.
* Dr. Sidwa described the situation in Gaza as a "man-made catastrophe" that is entirely preventable, and that participating in it or allowing it to happen is a choice.
* He stressed the importance of refusing to normalize these atrocities and refusing to dehumanize the Palestinians.
* Dr. Sidwa's testimony highlights the human dignity crisis in Gaza, with an entire people on the edge of survival due to the denial of basic necessities such as:
  + Food.
  + Shelter.
  + Water.
  + Medicine.
The speaker noted that the situation in Gaza is supported by the United States, starting with the Biden administration and now the Trump administration, and that American taxpayers are complicit in the genocide. The speaker finds it horrific that the US has not stopped the conflict and is instead involved in executing it, and that the Israelis could not execute it without US support. The speaker believes that Dr. Sidwa's testimony is just the tip of the iceberg, and that the situation in Gaza is even more dire than what Dr. Sidwa has described.
