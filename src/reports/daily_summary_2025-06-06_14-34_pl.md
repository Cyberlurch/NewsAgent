### Why is China BUYING so Much Land Near US Military Bases?

*Redacted*

Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoes Senate Bill 1109, which aimed to prevent the Chinese government from acquiring a 30% or greater interest in Arizona real estate.

*Key points*:
	* Bill passed by the Arizona legislature, controlled by Republicans
	+ Governor Hobbs used her veto power to block the bill, citing concerns about its effectiveness
	- Bill aimed to prevent the Chinese government from acquiring significant interests in Arizona real estate, particularly near military installations
	+ Governor Hobbs argued that the bill lacked clear implementation criteria, which could lead to arbitrary enforcement

Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers discusses the veto and the reasoning behind the bill. She argues that prevention is key and that the bill was intended to prevent the Chinese government from acquiring land that could be used for espionage or other malicious activities.

*Key points*:
	+ Chinese government has been known to use proxy companies and other means to acquire significant interests in foreign companies and real estate
	+ CCP's involvement in any significant land purchases near military installations is a concern for national security
	+ Senator Rogers believes that the bill was a necessary precaution to protect Arizona's critical infrastructure and national security

Senator Rogers also discusses Governor Hobbs' vetoes, noting that she has vetoed over 200 bills, including some that Senator Rogers had sponsored. One of these bills would have required hospitals to track the cost of treating illegal aliens, which Senator Rogers argued was a common-sense measure to understand the financial impact of illegal immigration.

*Key points*:
	+ Governor Hobbs has vetoed over 200 bills, including some that Senator Rogers had sponsored
	+ Senator Rogers believes that Governor Hobbs is out of touch with the concerns of Arizonans and is using her veto power to block common-sense legislation
	+ Arizona legislature plans to hold a vote to override Governor Hobbs' veto of Senate Bill 1109 in a couple of weeks
