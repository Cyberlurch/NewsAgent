## PREPAREDNESS

### [‚ö°24 Hours to CHAOS: Food, Cash, Gas Will be GONE in Your City!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXT488PVreA)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The speaker emphasizes that when an emergency alert system goes off, everyday resources will disappear quickly due to a just-in-time delivery system that is efficient during peace times but fragile in times of chaos. The locations analyzed include:
1. Gas stations: With an estimated 2 to 3 days' worth of gas in each station, and with 150,000 stations across North America, they will run dry in a few hours when tankers can't resupply.
2. Grocery stores: These rely on daily shipments from distributors and will be cleared out within 3 to 5 hours when panic buying ensues. Most stores have 2 to 3 days' worth of food and rely on trucked-in supplies, which will stop when trucks stop rolling.
3. Cell towers: With limited surge capacity and relying on power, they will be overwhelmed when everyone tries to communicate at the same time. The backup power lasts only 4 to 8 hours, after which there's no communication.
4. Banks: With less than 10% of money in circulation being physical cash, banks may be difficult to access during an emergency, and digital systems may fail due to cyber attacks or blackouts.
5. Power grid: The North American power grid is aging and fragile, with transformers being nearly 40 years old on average, and production components mainly from China. A sustained power outage could last indefinitely.
6. Towers and infrastructure: These rely on constant power and may fail during a disaster, with rural areas being more vulnerable due to limited access to high-speed internet.
Additionally, the speaker highlights the following scenarios:
* Liquor stores may be popular targets, but supplies will run quickly
* Fire stations will be overwhelmed and firefighting may become difficult without access to hydrants and backup systems
* Police and first responders will be unable to scale quickly, and law and order may evaporate quickly
* Grocery stores will run out of supplies, and food distribution centers will be affected, leading to a shortage of food
* Pharmacies will run out of medication, and insulin, antibiotics, and psychiatric medication will disappear quickly
* Jails may release inmates due to lack of food, water, and power, leading to an increase in crime
The speaker encourages viewers to prepare themselves and recommends Canadian Preparedness for high-quality survival gear. They emphasize the importance of being prepared to support oneself during a disaster scenario.



### [‚ö°ALERT: HISTORIC Attack on Russian NUKE BOMBERS! 50% Wiped Out! Trump Approved! DEFCON EMERGENCY!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ-2w19rX9Y)
*Prepper News Flash*  

On June 1st, NATO, Ukraine, and the United States conducted a joint operation to take out one-third of Russia's strategic nuclear strike capability. The attack occurred inside Russia, thousands of kilometers from the front line, and was reportedly carried out with the tacit approval of the Trump administration. The Ukrainian intelligence agency, SBU, was responsible for the operation, which used small quadricopter drones hidden in wooden containers on trucks to strike Russian airfields.
According to reports, the SBU damaged or destroyed over 40 Russian military aircraft, including strategic bombers, Tupolev Tu-95MS, Tupolev Tu-22M3, and Il-112 bombers. The operation was dubbed "spiderweb" and involved precise navigation and line-of-sight control from vehicles parked near the targets.
Russia's defense ministry labeled the attack as a terrorist attack and has downplayed the severity of the damage. However, the actual extent of the damage is around $2 billion, and the loss of these planes would severely impact Russia's ability to wage war.
The Ukrainian government claims that the strikes degraded Russia's long-range strike capabilities, and President Trump's administration has not denied or condemned the operation. Instead, Trump's warning to Putin just days earlier, stating that he was holding back the forces that could do something, implies that the attack may have been orchestrated by the West.
The attacks coincided with preparations for peace talks in Istanbul on June 2nd, 2025, and Ukraine claims that the strikes targeted Russia's ability to launch long-range strikes. The incident has sparked a strong reaction from Russia, with some calling for Vladimir Putin to take action to avenge the attack.
Sources within the Trump administration have corroborated that the Ukrainian intelligence agency informed Trump of the attack before it took place. According to CBS, White House officials were not aware of the operation beforehand.
The significance of this operation cannot be overstated. It marks a significant escalation in the conflict and a direct attack on Russia's nuclear capabilities. Russia now has several options to respond, including a nuclear strike, a direct conventional strike on NATO, or an escalation of hybrid warfare, including cyber attacks.
The author concludes that Ukraine's continued survival and resistance is due to its ability to receive support from the West, including the Trump administration. The author also notes that the attack has forced Russia to reassess its military strategy and policy, and that Vladimir Putin has a decision to make regarding how to respond to this bold attack.
Finally, the author advises listeners to be prepared for a significant escalation in the conflict, as the situation has entered a critical phase.



### [üö®üö®BREAKING: Nuclear Bomber Fleet DEVASTATED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kcj2MVH17k)
*The Poplar Report*  

The speaker, Steven Popppler, is discussing a significant attack on Russian bomber bases. The attack is being compared to the Pearl Harbor style attack and is considered devastating. Popppler claims that Russia is feeling vulnerable after the loss of its strategic bombers, which are nuclear capable.
The attack is believed to have been planned for about a year and a half under the codename "Operation Spider Web". The attackers used four modified shipping containers with drones inside to target four Russian air bases simultaneously. The drones were flown remotely from thousands of miles away and targeted the strategic bombers, causing significant damage and destruction.
The damage is estimated to be around $2 billion, with 40-41 Russian strategic bombers being damaged or destroyed. The attack has limited Russia's capability to launch air strikes against Eastern Europe, and Russia may feel pressured to respond with a nuclear strike.
In addition to the air bases, three trains were also destroyed or damaged, including one carrying munitions. There were also unconfirmed reports of explosions and fires across Russia. The speaker warns that Russia may be backed into a corner and may respond with a nuclear strike, potentially deploying a nuclear weapon.
The speaker believes that World War III is at the doorstep, with the next phase potentially unfolding. He advises viewers to stock up on necessities, as the price of oil and gas may skyrocket with the potential for strikes on Iran.
The speaker emphasizes the importance of verifying information, as misinformation may spread quickly in the coming days. He encourages viewers to check his channel for updates and to be cautious of false information.

## CHRISTIANITY

### [The Hope of Israel Revealed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgexkUJMrs8)
*Behold Israel*  

* The speaker believes the hope of Israel is not just about the land, but also about the Jewish people's return to their faith and the coming of the Messiah.
* 2,000 years ago, a Jewish leader named Saul (also known as Paul) spread the message about the Messiah, and the speaker is attempting to do the same today.
* However, the speaker notes that the way Jesus (or Yeshua) is perceived and taught today is often very different from the original Jewish understanding, and this can make it difficult to reach Jewish people with the true message of the Messiah.
* The speaker emphasizes that Yeshua is not a foreign name, but rather has its roots in the Jewish Old Testament. In the book of Ezra, Yeshua is mentioned as the name of the first high priest after the Babylonian captivity.
* The speaker explains that the name Yeshua is not a new name, but rather an existing Jewish name that means "salvation" in Hebrew. This name is mentioned in Matthew 1:21, where it is stated that Yeshua will save his people from their sins.
* The speaker notes that many English translations of the Bible translate Yeshua as "Jesus", which is derived from the Greek "Yesus". However, in the original Hebrew, the name is Yeshua.
* The speaker concludes that understanding the true meaning and significance of the name Yeshua is important for connecting with Jewish people and sharing the message of the Messiah.
