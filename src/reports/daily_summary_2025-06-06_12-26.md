### [âš¡Learn This Survival Skill Before its Too Late w/@GardeningInCanada](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jnis3Iz-6VU)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The conversation revolves around gardening and preparing for a potential apocalypse. The host is being guided by Gardening in Canada, an expert in the field, who is providing feedback on the host's gardening efforts. The host has set up a greenhouse with various plants, including peppers, herbs, and fruit trees. Gardening in Canada is providing constructive criticism and advice on how to improve the garden.
Some key points discussed include:
* The importance of proper spacing and soil temperature for pepper plants. Gardening in Canada notes that the host's pepper garden bed is well-spaced, but the soil may be too cold for optimal production.
* The use of flowers to attract pollinators. Gardening in Canada confirms that this is a good practice, but notes that it's not a cure-all for pest control.
* The host's irrigation system, which Gardening in Canada describes as "good for a 2-year-old." Gardening in Canada suggests using direct drippers or planting peppers near the irrigation holes for more efficient watering.
* The host's herb garden, which Gardening in Canada criticizes for using straight dirt from a bag. Gardening in Canada advises against using bagged dirt in containers, as it can be too heavy and cause the plants to suffocate.
* The host's tomato plants, which Gardening in Canada says have too-small cages. Gardening in Canada recommends using larger cages or providing support with strings to allow the plants to grow properly.
* The host's trellis, which Gardening in Canada says is a good idea, but notes that the host should have used bush beans instead of pole beans.
* The potential for aphid infestations, which Gardening in Canada warns can be a problem in hot weather. Gardening in Canada suggests using ladybugs or praying mantises to control the aphid population.
* The host's onion plants, which Gardening in Canada praises for being upright and untrimmed. Gardening in Canada notes that trimming the tops of onion plants is a common mistake that can reduce their growth.
* The host's cucumber plants, which are experiencing transplant shock. Gardening in Canada advises providing extra care, including shade and gentle watering, to help the plants recover.
* The potential for using the greenhouse to provide food for a family of four. Gardening in Canada notes that the space is not large enough to provide staple foods like potatoes, but can provide a variety of smaller crops like tomatoes and herbs.
Some specific details mentioned in the conversation include:
* The host's greenhouse is located in Saskatchewan, which is in zone 3.
* The host has 1.33 million subscribers to their channel.
* Gardening in Canada has invested a significant amount of time in teaching the host about gardening, but is not impressed with the host's progress.
* The host has used a Milwaukee 18-volt bit driver to build the garden beds.
* The host has a manifold irrigation system with four controls, but Gardening in Canada is not impressed with the setup.
* The host has planted a variety of crops, including peppers, herbs, tomatoes, cucumbers, and fruit trees.
* The host is concerned about the potential for persistent herbicide damage to the plants, which Gardening in Canada confirms is a possibility. Gardening in Canada advises adding nitrogen fertilizer to help decompose the herbicides and restore the soil health.
Overall, the conversation is focused on providing feedback and advice on the host's gardening efforts, with a focus on preparing for a potential apocalypse. Gardening in Canada is providing constructive criticism and expertise to help the host improve their garden and increase their chances of survival in a disaster scenario.

*The Poplar Report*  

Steve Popppler, an accountant, is hosting the Popppler Report, where he shares updates from his audience. The show is sponsored by Genesis Gold Group, which helps people invest in gold, silver, or platinum for their retirement accounts. The key points from the report are:
* **Trade talks between the US and China**: President Trump and President Xi of China held a phone call, which led to a meeting between the US and Chinese trade delegations. This indicates that a deal is likely being hammered out.
* **Car transport ship on fire**: A cargo ship carrying 3,000 vehicles, including 750 hybrid and electric vehicles, caught fire in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 300 miles south of Alaska. The cause of the fire is unknown, but it is suspected that the electric cars may have started it.
* **Interest rate cut in Europe**: The European Central Bank cut interest rates by 25 basis points to offset the impact of tariffs and other economic issues. The US Federal Reserve has not cut interest rates, which is seen as a political move.
* **US trade deficit**: The US trade deficit dropped by 55.5% in April, the largest decrease on record, to $61.6 billion. This is seen as a positive sign that the tariffs are working.
* **Harvard University**: The Trump administration has suspended entry of international students studying at Harvard, which is seen as a response to the university's refusal to provide information on its international students.
* **Steel and aluminum tariffs**: The Trump administration has raised tariffs on steel and aluminum to 50%, except for the United Kingdom, which is excluded from the tariffs.
* **Supreme Court blocks Mexico's lawsuit**: The Supreme Court blocked a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Mexico against US gun makers, alleging that they contributed to cartel violence.
* **Food shortages**: There are reports of food shortages, including a shortage of cottage cheese and plain yogurt. A farm in Maricopa County lost 6 million chickens, which will take two years to recover from.
* **Watchman reports**: The Watchman community has reported on various issues, including:
	+ A food shortage at Walmart, with empty shelves of chicken and salad.
	+ A problem with Owens breakfast sausage, which has a new recipe that is causing complaints.
	+ A strike by workers at the Chikita Banana Company in Panama, which has led to the firing of over 5,000 workers and may cause a shortage of bananas.
	+ A bill in upstate New York that aims to limit the number of dairy cows and dairy farms, which is seen as an attack on family-run farms.
	+ A garage door ordered from Home Depot took three months to arrive.
	+ Restaurants are serving smaller portions, known as shrinkflation, without reducing prices.
	+ There is a significant price spread for unled gas in West Phoenix, with some places charging 82 cents more than others.
Other notable points from the report include:
* **E-Verify**: Walmart is using E-Verify to check the immigration status of its employees, which has led to the loss of 12 associates in one store.
* **Biden administration**: The report mentions that the Biden administration had protected undocumented workers, but now they are being held accountable for their immigration status.
* **Pathway to citizenship**: The host suggests that he would not be opposed to a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers who are working hard and supporting their families.
* **Food prices**: The report warns of potential price increases for bananas due to the strike at the Chikita Banana Company and the shortage of chickens in Maricopa County.



### [Time To Get Your House In Order As The Middle Class Is Being â€˜Systemically Implodedâ€™](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPoNbpWe2Iw)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The current economic system is experiencing a significant breakdown, with the middle class collapsing at an alarming rate. The rich are getting richer, while the poor are becoming destitute, with many people living in tents or their cars. This is attributed to various factors, including:
* Jobs collapsing or being taken by AI
* Pensions collapsing or being used for government debt support, particularly in Europe and the United Kingdom
* The bond market struggling as governments fail to sell their long-term debts
* The price of gold increasing by 40% in a single year, and Bitcoin rising by over 50% in the same period
* The S&P and other stock markets showing marginal growth, indicating an abnormal economic situation
Many people are feeling the effects of this economic breakdown, with some working full-time but still struggling to afford basic needs. This has led to the concept of "functionally unemployed," where individuals have a job but are barely getting by. The government's reported unemployment rate of 4.2% is considered a joke, as it does not accurately reflect the true state of employment.
A report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity reveals that the true unemployment rate in the United States is around 24%, with every four working-age Americans either unable to find full-time work, stuck in poverty-wage jobs, or not earning enough to survive. This includes gig workers and others who may be working limited hours.
The situation is dire, with many people struggling to make ends meet, despite working hard and budgeting carefully. The emails received by the speaker, including one from a subscriber named John, illustrate the difficulties faced by individuals who are struggling to afford basic needs, such as a place to live.
John's story is not unique, as many people are facing similar challenges. He works as a carpenter, earning around $17,000 per year, but is struggling to afford tools and a place to live after his van was broken into and his tools stolen. The police failed to investigate, and John is now trying to recover from this setback.
The speaker emphasizes that the current economic system is broken and cannot be fixed. The fiat system, which has been in place since the end of World War II, is coming to an end. The rules of doing business are changing daily, making it challenging for businesses to operate and for individuals to have job security.
Some key points to consider:
* The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index has dropped to 50.8, the second-lowest reading in history
* Inflation has been rising, with basic food products increasing by up to 50% in the last few years
* The UK government's overt taxation is killing jobs, with a 10% drop in job openings in one month
* Businesses need stability, but the current environment is marked by legal and political turmoil, with judges making economic decisions rather than experts
* The speaker offers courses and programs to help individuals navigate this economic landscape and create alternative sources of income, such as digital courses teaching skills to others.
Overall, the economic situation is critical, and individuals need to be aware of the challenges and take steps to protect themselves and their finances.
