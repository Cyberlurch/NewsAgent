## PREPAREDNESS

### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The speaker discusses the mistakes they have made as a prepper and what they would do differently if they had the chance. One mistake is focusing on showy, iconic products instead of going for obscurity, blending in, and serving a functional purpose. For example, they would have chosen a diesel vehicle instead of their current truck, opting for a more inconspicuous look.
Another mistake is rushing and overestimating the speed of events. The speaker notes that their predictions are often accurate, but their calculations are wrong because things rarely happen as quickly as they expect. They mention the pandemic and World War II as examples of slow-moving events that surprised them.
The speaker highlights the importance of buying land, not necessarily the best land, but something that is off the grid and not appealing to others. They note that wealthy individuals are buying up land in areas with little infrastructure, and advise that the least expensive land now will be the most expensive later on.
The speaker also critiques the "off-grid" myth, where people imagine that living off the grid will be simple and easy. They assert that it is a challenging lifestyle that requires a lot of work and that it should not be taken lightly.
Other mistakes the speaker has made include not focusing enough on skills, such as taking courses in survival and first aid, and not having a skilled trade to accompany their prepping. They also warn against having too much gear and not being organized, instead advocating for master one tool and sticking with it.
The speaker concludes by encouraging viewers to share their own mistakes and regrets as preppers in the comments section. They emphasize the importance of learning from mistakes and staying focused on practicality and functionality in prepping.

### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

The host of the Prepper News Channel discusses three major stories related to World War III:
1. The supposed rift between the Pentagon and the Israeli military, with Israel allegedly receiving a significant shipment of weapons daily. The host speculates that this could be a tactic to enable Israel to engage in a full-scale conflict with Iran, citing the flow of weapons as a key indicator of the agenda.
2. The growing hostility and tension between Germany and Russia, which may lead to a replay of World War II. The host notes that Germany has been supporting Ukraine's construction of long-range missile systems, which could pose a significant threat to Russia. Russia has threatened to strike NATO assets if this continues, prompting Germany to attempt to circumvent the issue by empowering Ukraine to construct the systems domestically.
3. The alleged leak of blueprints and sensitive information regarding Russia's secret nuclear bases, including 3D renderings, security details, and missile silo plans. The host questions whether this was an intentional leak to mislead NATO or Western intelligence agencies, or simply a bureaucratic mistake.
The host notes that Russia has a history of leaking misleading information to throw off NATO's scent, and that this leak provides a significant advantage to NATO in terms of understanding Russia's nuclear infrastructure. However, Russia's ability to adapt and potentially neutralize these facilities is still unclear.
The host also discusses the possibility that this leak may have been used to boost Putin's image and target internal rivals, as well as to distract NATO and Western intelligence agencies from the real locations of Russia's nuclear bunkers. He concludes that the leak is more likely a form of misdirection, as it provides falsifiable information and would be unlikely to be intentionally leaked without a clear purpose.
The host also touches on the possibility that the leak may be a form of propaganda or psychological operation, as it would be unlikely for Russia to reveal this information unless they knew it had already been compromised. He notes that Western intelligence agencies would likely have accessed the information already, making the leak redundant.
Overall, the host concludes that the leak is a significant development in the lead up to World War III, as it exposes Russia's nuclear vulnerabilities and may have strategic implications for the conflict.



### [üö®üö®China Totally Violated Agreement- Here It Comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8oEJdkpqf4)
*The Poplar Report*  

The speaker, Steve Popppler, begins by stating that the trade war between the United States and China is imploding, citing a halt in the tariff truce declared between the two countries. He explains that President Trump has hinted that he will no longer play "Mr. Nice Guy" with China, citing violations of the tariff agreement.
Popppler states that China has failed to open up its rare earth minerals exports to the United States and Europe, denying critical components needed for the production of weapons. He argues that this is a critical military application that affects the United States' ability to rebuild its military capabilities.
He also highlights China's imposition of a 75% tariff on plastic products from the United States, which he claims is a violation of the agreement. Additionally, he notes that China has blocked the export of critical components for jet engines, a move that he believes is intended to hinder the United States' military capabilities.
Popppler argues that the Trump administration has been dealing with China's nefarious tactics as if they were a game, but that the stakes are much higher. He claims that China's actions are not just about trade, but about national security.
He also touches on the issue of trade talks with China, stating that the talks are not going in the right direction and that the Chinese are not behaving in good faith. He argues that the European Union is also taking advantage of the United States, citing unfair trade practices and a lack of reciprocity in trade agreements.
Popppler also addresses the issue of the European Union's negotiations with the United States, stating that the EU is not being fair and is taking advantage of the United States. He claims that the EU is waving certain provisions for other countries, but not for the United States, and that this is unfair.
He also makes a commentary on the quality of coffee in Europe, stating that it is much better than what is available in the United States. He also touches on the issue of the United States' manufacturing capabilities, stating that the country no longer manufactures as much as it used to and that this is a problem.
Popppler concludes by stating that the situation with China and the European Union is complex and that the United States must crack down on China to protect its interests. He argues that this will have far-reaching impacts on the economy and that Americans must be prepared for the consequences.

*Neil McCoy Ward*  

‚Ä¢ Investors are selling US government bonds, also known as "Sell America", which is a trend driven by the decline of the US dollar.
‚Ä¢ The US government has had to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money due to low demand for bonds, causing the 30-year treasury yields to rise above 5%.
‚Ä¢ This increase in bond yields makes borrowing more expensive for individuals and the government, which could lead to a debt crisis.
‚Ä¢ The global financial system is facing a "death spiral" or "debt spiral" as more fiat currencies are created, weakening their value.
‚Ä¢ Gold and silver prices are rising due to the weakening of fiat currencies and the debt spiral, making physical assets a viable hedge against inflation.
‚Ä¢ The author predicts that the US government may eventually transition to a gold standard or a combination of assets, including Bitcoin, to stabilize the currency.
‚Ä¢ Credit rating agencies, such as Moody's, have downgraded the US government's credit rating, indicating a serious decline in creditworthiness.
‚Ä¢ The author recommends diversifying portfolios with physical assets, such as gold and silver, and being prepared for a potential debt crisis.
‚Ä¢ The author is promoting a new investment course on gold and silver, offering a 90% discount for those who sign up early.
