## PREPAREDNESS

### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The speaker, a prepper, reflects on mistakes he has made in his prepping journey. He emphasizes the importance of blending in and being inconspicuous, rather than showcasing off-grid preparedness. He advises getting a diesel vehicle, even an older one, and installing a hidden winch, as diesel is more reliable and easier to store.
He also talks about rushing into preparations, which he attributes to his tendency to accurately predict outcomes but miscalculate timelines. He cites the COVID-19 pandemic and World War II as examples of events that took longer to unfold than he initially anticipated. He advises taking a more realistic approach to preparedness, focusing on obscurity, and prioritizing the least expensive options.
Another mistake he acknowledges is believing in the off-grid myth, thinking that freedom often equates with simplicity. He notes that being off-grid can be a challenging and labor-intensive lifestyle, and it's essential to understand the sacrifices involved.
The speaker also emphasizes the importance of developing skills, not being afraid to seek advice from others, and taking courses in survival and first aid. He encourages preppers to focus on mastering one tool or skill rather than collecting a vast array of gear.
Finally, he notes that having too much gear and poor organization can be a significant issue, leading to confusion and inefficiencies in crisis situations. He advises finding one good tool and sticking with it, rather than constantly trying to upgrade or acquire new gear.
Some key points and recommendations from the speaker include:
* Prioritize inconspicuousness and blend in with society
* Consider getting a diesel vehicle, even an older one
* Focus on obscurity and the least expensive options
* Develop a realistic approach to preparedness, understanding that timelines may be longer than anticipated
* Believe in the off-grid myth, and understand the sacrifices involved
* Develop skills, such as taking courses in survival and first aid
* Focus on mastering one tool or skill rather than collecting a vast array of gear
* Avoid having too much gear and poor organization
* Prioritize staying organized and simplified for crisis situations



### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

The host of the Prepper News Channel provides an update on three major stories related to World War III:
1. The supposed rift between the Pentagon and the Israeli military: The host suggests that the rift may not be real and that the weapons being shipped to Israel may indicate a larger agenda. Israel is still receiving shipments of weapons and appears to be enabled to engage in a full-on conflict with Iran.
2. Germany and Russia: Tensions between the two nations are increasing, and Germany has stated that all restrictions on the use of NATO weaponry in Ukraine have been lifted. This includes the development of long-range missile systems that can surpass the Taurus missile. The Russians have threatened a direct strike on NATO assets or targets in Germany if this happens.
3. The alleged leak of blueprints for Russia's secret nuclear bases: A German news agency, Dash Spiegel, has obtained 2 million documents exposing Russia's nuclear program. The documents include blueprints, security details, and plans for missile silos, bunkers, and tunnels. The leak potentially gives NATO an advantage in a full-on war with Russia and could be a game-changer in terms of defense.
The host suggests that the leak may not be intentional, but rather a bureaucratic oversight. The documents include information on European subsidiary companies that have worked on projects inside Russian nuclear bunkers, which could have implications for the leak's authenticity. The host proposes that the leak could be part of a disinformation campaign to mislead NATO and focus attention on the wrong targets.
The host discusses the potential consequences of the leak and the implications for Russia's nuclear program. He notes that the leak could be embarrassing for Russia and may not be well-received by the domestic population. He also suggests that the leak could be used to boost Putin's image and target internal rivals.
The host concludes that the leak is significant and potentially game-changing, but it remains to be seen whether it's authentic or part of a disinformation campaign. He notes that the documents have been leaked to Western intelligence agencies and suggests that the information may be obsolete now that it's been released to the public.
Overall, the host believes that the leak highlights Russia's vulnerabilities and could contribute to a more tense and dangerous environment. He notes that the continued flow of weapons to Israel and the increasing hostilities between Germany and Russia are also contributing factors to the escalating tensions.



### [üö®üö®China Totally Violated Agreement- Here It Comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8oEJdkpqf4)
*The Poplar Report*  

The speaker, Steve Popppler, starts by discussing the recent halt in the trade war truce between the United States and China. He notes that President Trump has hinted that the US will no longer be playing "Mr. Nice Guy" with China, and that the US may impose higher tariffs on China in response to China's violations of the tariff agreement.
Popppler explains that China has failed to follow through on its commitments to open up its markets for US exports, particularly rare earth minerals used in the production of weapons and defense systems. He argues that this is a critical military issue, as the US relies heavily on Chinese imports of these minerals, which China is now restricting.
Popppler also notes that China has imposed a 75% tariff on plastic products from the US, which is a violation of the tariff agreement. He suggests that the US could respond by imposing a similar tariff on Chinese plastic products.
The speaker also discusses the US's trade negotiations with the European Union, noting that the EU is trying to take advantage of the US by waving certain trade barriers for some countries but not for the US. He argues that the US has been easy prey for China and the EU due to its willingness to make concessions.
Popppler also touches on the US economy, noting that the country is reliant on printing money to stay afloat and that the US is no longer a manufacturing powerhouse. He argues that the US needs to crack down on China and other countries that take advantage of the US.
The speaker concludes by emphasizing that the latest developments in the US-China trade war will have significant impacts on the economy and consumers. He notes that higher tariffs on Chinese goods, such as plastic and metal products, could lead to higher prices for consumers and that automation and AI could further disrupt the workforce.

### [‚ö†Ô∏è Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyoljrgDJY)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The speaker discusses the current state of the economy and the rising gold prices, which are causing investors to dump bonds. He notes that another financial crisis is unfolding and believes that authorities are preparing for a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to address the crisis. The speaker argues that the debt spiral is a major issue, where governments create more currency to pay interest on their debt, leading to a weakening of the currency's purchasing power.
The speaker highlights the recent downgrading of the US debt by Moody's and the increasing bond yields, which make it more expensive for individuals to borrow money. He also notes that the big beautiful bill that has been passed will add $3.5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years, which will make it difficult for the US to service its debt.
The speaker sees a connection between the rise in gold prices and the weakening of fiat currencies. He believes that as more dollars flow back to the US, there will be high levels of inflation, leading to a possible shift to a gold standard or a combination of assets, including Bitcoin. The speaker warns that the US is headed towards debt default if it continues to print more money to pay interest on its debt.
The speaker also discusses the credit rating agencies, which he believes are flawed and did not anticipate the 2008 financial crisis. He notes that the current downgrading of the US debt is significant and unprecedented.
To protect oneself from the debt spiral and the impending financial crisis, the speaker recommends holding physical assets, being well-diversified, and considering investments in tangible assets like gold and silver. He believes that these assets will hold their value over time and advises individuals to look ahead and see how history is repeating itself.
The speaker announces that he has launched a new investment program that focuses on gold and silver investments and that he is offering a 90% discount on the course, which is still in the pre-launch phase. He plans to release new videos every weekend, providing guidance on investing in gold and silver.
Finally, the speaker predicts that the period of low interest rates is coming to an end due to the debt spiral and believes that authorities will struggle to keep interest rates low in the future.
