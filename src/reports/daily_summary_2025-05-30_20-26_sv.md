**PREPAREDNESS**

 Canadian Prepper reflects on mistakes made in prepping journey. Major mistake prioritizing iconography over obscurity. Having a plain, grayman truck would be more effective. Diesel vehicle more practical, can store fuel. They note that diesel vehicles being phased out may be due to their empowering nature.

Mistake was rushing into decisions, not taking a more realistic approach. They predict things happening quickly, but they happen on a much slower timeline.

They advise against believing in off-grid myth. It is a lot of work and freedom does not always equate to simplicity. They recommend buying a plot of land in remote area, even if not the best, as it will likely increase in value after a disaster.

Importance of skills, not just gear, for a prepper. Taking courses in survival and first aid would be beneficial. Having a skilled trade would be valuable in post-disaster scenario.

Some key takeaways include prioritizing obscurity over iconography, buying a diesel vehicle and storing fuel, being more realistic about timeline of disasters and fallout, not believing in off-grid myth, focusing on skills and organization, having a limited number of high-quality, reliable tools and mastering them, and using one brand for all tools and equipment to simplify organization.
