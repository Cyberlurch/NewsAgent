### [‚ö°ALERT! Israel is Preparing to Strike NUCLEAR  Sites!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4_jDN45yLaM)
*Prepper News Flash*  

The speaker presents the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, citing confirmed reports from Israel. This strike might be a retaliatory move for a US strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, which Israel is said to be preparing for. The speaker argues that given the extensive preparations being made by Israel, including opening public bomb shelters and increasing hospital capacity, an attack is likely to happen soon, possibly during the holiday of Shavuot.
The speaker criticizes Donald Trump's statement that he is not involved in the decision to strike Iran, citing inconsistencies in US actions and the lack of withdrawal of US support for Israel. Additionally, the speaker highlights the irrational language used by Trump in negotiations with Iran, interpreting it as a bluff aimed at gaining an advantage in the negotiations.
According to a Knesset source, Israel has been planning a potential attack on Iran for a long time and has recently held covert meetings to discuss the plan. The speaker notes that the Israeli economy would be paralyzed within 2-4 days, and food supplies have been stockpiled in underground government war bunkers.
Iran has issued a notice to airmen announcing temporary airspace closures around Tehran on June 1st and June 2nd, which could be a sign of posturing or a warning of potential retaliation if an attack is launched.
The speaker explains that Israel's Samson Option, a military doctrine that allows for the use of nuclear weapons in response to an existential threat, is closely linked to the US and would be used if Israel felt threatened by the retaliatory attacks from Iran.
The Iranian military and FARS news agency have warned that Trump's threat to destroy nuclear sites crosses a red line, urging the US to drop threats and sanctions for diplomacy. However, the speaker argues that the removal of sanctions would be more problematic for Israel than Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon, as it would allow Iran to rapidly increase its economy.
The US, UK, France, and Germany plan to submit a draft resolution at the June 9th International Atomic Energy Agency board meeting declaring Iran in breach of nuclear safeguards. This move could escalate tensions and impose snapback sanctions.
The speaker concludes that the situation is precarious and highlights the inconsistent statements and actions of the US and its leaders, ultimately pointing to the likelihood of an Israeli attack on Iran.



### [üö®üö®Air DEFENSES On Alert For 72 Hours! - Watchmen Updates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgkG9Ji9l_s)
*The Poplar Report*  

The Popppler Report is discussing several news updates and watchman reports. In the first report, the host, Steve Popppler, discusses the US tariffs and the revenue generated from them. He notes that the US government brought in a record $23 billion in revenue in the past month, which is slightly exceeding the previous record of $17 billion. Steve also mentions the potential impact of the tariffs on the deficit and the economy.
The second report is about Iran, which has closed its airspace around Than for rocket firing and drone exercises. The United States has asked Israel to back down from an attack on Iran, but Israel is reportedly considering taking action. Steve notes that if Iran acquires a nuclear weapon, it could be a significant threat to the region and the world.
The third report is about a freedom flotilla heading to Gaza to break the Israeli blockade. The flotilla is being led by Greta Thunberg, the environmental activist. Steve is skeptical about the chances of the flotilla succeeding and notes that Israel has previously blocked visits from other countries to the Palestinian Authority.
The report also discusses Germany's consideration of a 10% tax on internet companies like Google and Meta, which could be seen as a tariff. Steve suggests that the US retaliate by imposing a similar tax on German goods.
Additionally, the report mentions a massive recall on Hormel Dinty Moore beef stew due to contamination with foreign material. Steve advises viewers to check their pantries for the recalled products and return them to the stores for a refund.
The report also includes several viewer updates, including:
* A complaint about Walmart's delivery service and a recall on frozen chicken breast with a lot of water added to the product.
* A complaint about a pharmacist's overcharging and double billing on a colonoscopy procedure.
* A conversation with a dairy guy at Publix, who talks about the benefits of A2 milk and European butter.
* A suggestion to use bay leaves and oxygen absorbers to preserve dry goods from bugs and mold.
The report concludes with a reminder to viewers to listen to their own intuition and advice, and to be cautious about buying essential items in case prices rise in the future.



### [‚ö†Ô∏è Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyoljrgDJY)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The speaker begins by discussing the trend of investors selling US government bonds, particularly in the "$20 billion bond release" that received low demand, resulting in the government having to pay a higher interest rate. This is causing concern as it makes debt more expensive for individuals and highlights the global financial system's crisis. The speaker also mentions Moody's downgrading the US credit rating, which is serious and indicates a potential crisis.
The speaker explains that fiat currencies are weakening, leading to a debt spiral. As the US dollar weakens, inflation will increase, and the US may eventually have to return to a gold standard or a collection of assets including gold, Bitcoin, and other assets to stabilize the currency. Governments know this and are preparing for a central bank digital currency.
To protect oneself from this crisis, the speaker recommends holding physical assets, being diversified, and considering gold and silver as part of a long-term investment portfolio. The speaker also warns that the period of low interest rates may be coming to an end, which will have significant implications for the economy.
The speaker discusses the unsustainable levels of debt worldwide, with the US holding 35% of the world's debt. Japan is also holding significant debt, and a default could lead to a currency crisis. The speaker predicts that bond yields will continue to rise, causing investors to jump ship, and leading to instability and nervousness.
The speaker also discusses the pension crisis, stating that there will not be enough workers to support retirees and that the system is predicated on earnings and payments from workers. The speaker recommends creating a gold and silver pension program to protect one's life savings.
Finally, the speaker warns that taxes will increase, particularly in the UK and Euro zone, and that military conflicts will escalate as currencies depreciate and collapse. The speaker believes that fiat currencies will soon give way to central bank digital currencies and that it is essential to protect oneself through diversified portfolios and physical assets.
Some key points from the transcript include:
* Investors are selling US government bonds, causing interest rates to rise and making debt more expensive.
* Fiat currencies are weakening, leading to a debt spiral and potentially a gold standard or collection of assets.
* Governments are preparing for a central bank digital currency.
* Physical assets, diversification, and gold and silver are recommended as part of a long-term investment portfolio.

‚Ä¢ The speaker discusses the feast of weeks, also known as Pentecost, and how it is a divine prophecy that celebrates the wheat harvest and the giving of the law to Israel at Mount Sinai.

‚Ä¢ The speaker concludes by emphasizing the significance of Pentecost as the day when God's presence moved from dwelling in a temple made with hands to dwelling in human hearts, and the day when the harvest of souls began.
Important numbers mentioned:
* 2,000 years since Pentecost
* 7 Sabbaths (Leviticus 23:15-16)
* 50 days (Leviticus 23:16)
* 3,000 people who died at Mount Sinai
* 3,000 souls added to the church on Pentecost
Causal links:
* God's plan is revealed through the feasts, including Pentecost
* Pentecost is connected to the giving of the law at Mount Sinai
* The instructions for the wave loaves in Leviticus 23:17 symbolize the body of Christ and the unity of Jews and Gentiles
