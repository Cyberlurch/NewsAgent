## PREPAREDNESS

### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The speaker, a prepper, shares their personal mistakes and lessons learned in the field of preparedness. They emphasize the importance of being a "Greyman," meaning not drawing attention to oneself, and achieving obscurity in one's preparedness efforts.
The speaker's first mistake was having a showy truck with all the bells and whistles. In hindsight, they would have opted for a diesel truck with a hidden winch, blending in rather than standing out.
Another lesson learned is the importance of being realistic about timelines in preparedness. The speaker notes that they often rush into decisions, expecting events to unfold more quickly than they actually do. This is illustrated by their accurate predictions of the COVID-19 pandemic and World War II, but incorrect timelines.
The speaker also highlights the value of buying land, particularly in areas that are off the beaten path and undesirable to others. They caution against believing the "off-grid myth," which often romanticizes self-sufficiency as simple and self-rewarding. In reality, off-grid living requires significant effort and labor.
The speaker also advises against over-investing in gear and focusing on skills. They note that having too much gear can lead to complexity and disorganization, making it difficult to stay organized and proficient. Instead, they recommend finding one or two reliable tools and mastering them.
The speaker concludes by encouraging viewers to share their own mistakes and lessons learned in the comments section. They emphasize the importance of community and collaboration in preparedness, and invite viewers to support the channel by visiting their website for high-quality survival gear.
Some key takeaways from the transcript include:
* Being a "Greyman" is important in preparedness, as it can help to avoid drawing attention to oneself
* Diesel vehicles are a good option for preparedness, as they can store fuel and be used for various equipment
* Land is an important aspect of preparedness, particularly in areas that are off the beaten path and undesirable to others
* Off-grid living is not as simple and self-rewarding as it may seem, requiring significant effort and labor
* Focusing on skills is important, and taking courses or seeking expert advice can be helpful
* Having too much gear can lead to complexity and disorganization, and it's better to find one or two reliable tools and master them.



### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

The presenter starts by discussing three major stories: the supposed rift between the Pentagon and Israeli military, tensions between Germany and Russia, and alleged leaks of Russian secret nuclear bases.
Regarding the first story, the presenter notes that Israel is receiving regular shipments of weapons and seems to be fully enabled to engage in a conflict with Iran. He warns that where weapons flow, the truth flows, and suggests that this could be an indication of a hidden agenda.
The second story focuses on the tension between Germany and Russia, highlighting the Russia's concerns about NATO's long-range missile systems. Germany has recently stated that all restrictions on the use of NATO weaponry have been lifted, short of declaring an official support for Ukraine. This has sparked concerns about the potential for a direct strike on NATO assets, including Brussels and targets in Germany.
The third story concerns the alleged leak of blueprints of Russia's secret nuclear bases. The presenter notes that 2 million documents were leaked, including blueprints, security details, and information on missile silos, bunkers, and power grids. This leak could give NATO an advantage in case of a full-on war with Russia.
The presenter discusses the implications of this leak, including the potential impact on Russia's cyber security infrastructure and the creation of a virtual mapping system of Russia's missile defense capabilities. He also notes that Russia's nuclear bunker infrastructure is vulnerable to sabotage and direct attack.
The presenter raises the question of whether the leak was intentional, citing historical instances where Russia has leaked misleading information to throw NATO off its scent. He suggests that the leak could be a form of subterfuge and misdirection, intended to focus NATO's attention on the revealed facilities, while hiding the real locations of Russia's bunkers.
Some arguments support the hypothesis that the leak was intentional, including the possibility that it was used for deterrence, misdirection, or to target internal rivals. Others argue that the leak was likely a result of bureaucratic incompetence.
The presenter concludes by noting that the leak is a major embarrassment for Russia, potentially boosting Putin's image and exposing bureaucratic negligence. He suggests that the leak may have been used as a form of propaganda or psychological operation, rather than an honest attempt to reveal information.

### [‚ö†Ô∏è Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyoljrgDJY)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

**Bond Market Trends**
* Investors are dumping US government bonds, a trend known as "Sell America"
* This is part of a larger trend of strategic alliances between China, Russia, and BRICS nations aimed at reducing the US dollar's influence
* As a result, the US government has had to pay a higher interest rate to borrow money in global debt markets
* The 30-year US treasury bond has reached above 5% interest rate, a worrying sign for the economy
**Debt Spiral**
* The debt spiral is a vicious cycle where governments print more money to pay interest on their debt, leading to inflation and higher interest rates
* This cycle is unsustainable and will lead to a debt crisis
* The author believes that the US government will have to put the US on a gold standard or a combination of assets, including Bitcoin, to stabilize the currency
**Credit Rating Agencies**
* Moody's downgraded the US credit rating to AA+ from AAA, a serious warning sign for the economy
* Credit rating agencies are often flawed and have been criticized for their failures before the 2008 financial crisis
* The author believes that these agencies are not reliable and that the downgrade of the US credit rating is a sign of a major economic shift
**Protecting Yourself**
* The author recommends investing in physical assets, such as gold and silver, and being well-diversified
* He also suggests looking ahead and studying historical patterns to predict future economic trends
* He is releasing new courses on gold and silver investments, which are available at a discounted rate due to the pre-launch phase
**Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs)**
* The author believes that CBDCs are the next step in the evolution of currencies and that governments are preparing for this move
* He notes that the Eurozone is particularly aggressive in its pursuit of a CBDC, which he believes will lead to an authoritarian state
**Gold and Silver**
* The author recommends investing in gold and silver as a long-term hedge against inflation and currency depreciation
* He notes that these assets have historically preserved value over long periods of time and have been a store of wealth for thousands of years
* He also suggests diversifying investments and holding physical assets rather than just paper or digital assets
**Interest Rates**
* The author believes that the period of low interest rates is coming to an end due to the debt spiral
* He notes that central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, will eventually be unable to keep interest rates low and that this will have major economic implications.
