## PREPAREDNESS

### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The speaker, a prepper, shares several mistakes he has made in his prepping journey. One of the biggest mistakes he made was regarding his truck, which was a diesel vehicle with elaborate winches and accessories. He regrets not opting for a more inconspicuous and practical approach, sticking to his desire for something that looked iconic and impressive for his YouTube channel. He advises others to prioritize obscurity and functional simplicity over iconic appearance.
Another mistake he made was rushing into decisions, overestimating the speed of collapse and not taking a more realistic view of how things would play out. He shares that his predictions are often accurate, but his calculations are sometimes wrong, and being more patient would have allowed him to optimize his decisions.
The speaker also discusses the importance of owning land, not necessarily the best piece of land, but rather something that is off the beaten path and has no infrastructure, making it difficult to access. This approach would allow for a secure starting point in the event of a collapse.
The speaker also cautions against believing in the off-grid myth, suggesting that going off-grid may not be as easy or simple as it seems, and may require a lot of work and sacrifice. He advises that having a realistic understanding of what off-grid living entails is essential before taking the leap.
The speaker also shares that not focusing on skills and not taking advice from others has been another mistake he has made. He suggests that taking courses in survival, first aid, and skilled trades can be beneficial and that having a skilled trade to accompany one's prepping efforts can be useful.
Finally, the speaker advises against having too much gear and not being organized, suggesting that having a small set of high-quality tools and staying within a specific brand to maintain compatibility can be more effective than collecting a large amount of gear.
Throughout the discussion, the speaker emphasizes the importance of being realistic, being prepared, and prioritizing practicality and simplicity over appearance or desires.



### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

‚Ä¢ The analyst highlights three major stories today: a supposed rift between the Pentagon and Israel, tensions between Germany and Russia, and a confirmed leak of blueprints of Russia's secret nuclear bases.
‚Ä¢ The first story refers to the increasing amount of weapons flowing to Israel, which suggests that Israel may be enabled to engage in a full-on conflict with Iran.
‚Ä¢ The second story pertains to Germany and Russia, where tensions are escalating, possibly leading to a rerun of World War II. Germany has recently stated that all restrictions on the use of NATO weaponry have been lifted on Ukraine, and Russia has threatened to strike NATO assets if Ukraine receives missile systems capable of hitting targets within Russia.
‚Ä¢ The third story is about the leak of blueprints of Russia's secret nuclear bases, including 2 million documents that expose Russia's nuclear program. The leak allegedly originated from an online Russian procurement database, which may have been an intentional leak to mislead Western intelligence agencies or an oversight by Russian bureaucrats.
‚Ä¢ The leaked documents reveal sensitive information about Russia's nuclear facilities, including blueprints, security details, and plans for missile silos, bunkers, and tunnels. This leak may have been done to create a false sense of security or to misdirect Western intelligence agencies from the real locations of Russia's nuclear facilities.
‚Ä¢ Experts argue that this leak may be a tool for Russia to gain an advantage in a future war, as it exposes vulnerabilities in Russia's nuclear defenses. It is also possible that this leak was done to boost Putin's image or to target internal rivals.
‚Ä¢ Counterarguments suggest that the leak may be an intentional ploy by Russia to mislead Western intelligence agencies or to create a red herring. The leak may also be a result of bureaucratic negligence or a deliberate attempt to create a propaganda exercise.
‚Ä¢ The analyst concludes that this leak is a significant development, as it exposes Russia's major nuclear upgrades and vulnerabilities, which could potentially be used as a bargaining chip in a future war. The leak may also contribute to the growing tensions between Russia and the West, potentially leading to a more significant conflict.

### [‚ö†Ô∏è Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyoljrgDJY)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The speaker warns that another financial crisis is imminent, citing the dumping of US government bonds by investors, the rise in gold and silver prices, and the weakening of the US dollar. The speaker notes that this trend is not unique to the US dollar, but is a global phenomenon, affecting most fiat currencies.
The speaker explains that the increased demand for gold and silver is a result of the weakening of fiat currencies, which are experiencing a "debt spiral." The debt spiral occurs when a country creates more currency to pay off debts, which leads to inflation and a weaker currency. The speaker believes that this is why the value of gold and silver is increasing, as investors are seeking a safe-haven asset to protect their wealth from inflation.
The speaker also discusses the implications of the "big beautiful bill" that has been passed, which will add $3.5 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years. The speaker notes that this will make it harder for the US government to service its debt, which will likely lead to higher interest rates and inflation.
The speaker also touches on the topic of credit rating agencies, noting that they have a reputation for downgrading countries just before a crisis, which is likely to happen in the US. The speaker believes that this is a sign of the "new world" that we are entering, and that investors should be prepared for a significant shift in the global financial landscape.
The speaker recommends physical assets and diversification as a way for investors to protect themselves from the impending crisis. The speaker also mentions the importance of looking ahead and reading history from the past to anticipate future trends.
The speaker also discusses the rise of cryptocurrencies, noting that Bitcoin is a "place" for investors to consider, but cautions that it is not a stable asset in the short term. The speaker recommends gold and silver as part of a long-term diversified portfolio, as they have a history of being a store of value.
The speaker also announces a new investment course on gold and silver, which is available for pre-launch at a 90% discount. The course will include video modules and PDF guides to help investors learn how to invest in gold and silver.
Finally, the speaker notes that the period of low interest rates is likely coming to an end, and that the Federal Reserve will not be able to keep rates as low as they have been in the past. The speaker believes that this is because of the debt spiral and the need for the Fed to raise rates to combat inflation.
