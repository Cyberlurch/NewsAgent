### [Why is China BUYING so much land near US military bases? | Redaced w Clayton Morris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K6v-yb_oDI)
*Redacted*  

Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs vetoed Senate Bill 1109, which aimed to prevent the Chinese government and its state-owned enterprises from acquiring a 30% or greater interest in Arizona real estate. The bill was designed to safeguard critical infrastructure, including military installations like the Luke Air Force Base, from potential foreign espionage. Governor Hobbs argued that the bill was ineffective and lacked clear implementation criteria, which could lead to arbitrary enforcement.
Key points about the bill and its veto include:
* The bill was passed by the Arizona legislature, controlled by Republicans
* Governor Hobbs used her veto power to block the bill, citing concerns about its effectiveness
* The bill aimed to prevent the Chinese government from acquiring significant interests in Arizona real estate, particularly near military installations
* Governor Hobbs argued that the bill lacked clear implementation criteria, which could lead to arbitrary enforcement
Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers, a former Air Force pilot, discussed the veto and the reasoning behind the bill. She argued that prevention is key and that the bill was intended to prevent the Chinese government from acquiring land that could be used for espionage or other malicious activities. Senator Rogers stated that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) would likely be involved in any significant land purchases, even if they do not directly own 30% of the property.
Some key points about Senator Rogers' argument include:
* The Chinese government has been known to use proxy companies and other means to acquire significant interests in foreign companies and real estate
* The CCP's involvement in any significant land purchases near military installations is a concern for national security
* Senator Rogers believes that the bill was a necessary precaution to protect Arizona's critical infrastructure and national security
Senator Rogers also discussed the broader context of Governor Hobbs' vetoes, noting that she has vetoed over 200 bills, including some that Senator Rogers had sponsored. One of these bills would have required hospitals to track the cost of treating illegal aliens, which Senator Rogers argued was a common-sense measure to understand the financial impact of illegal immigration.
Some key points about Governor Hobbs' vetoes include:
* Governor Hobbs has vetoed over 200 bills, including some that Senator Rogers had sponsored
* Senator Rogers believes that Governor Hobbs is out of touch with the concerns of Arizonans and is using her veto power to block common-sense legislation
* The Arizona legislature plans to hold a vote to override Governor Hobbs' veto of Senate Bill 1109 in a couple of weeks
Senator Rogers expressed concern about the national security implications of allowing the Chinese government to acquire significant interests in Arizona real estate. She noted that the CCP has been known to use its economic influence to gain strategic advantages, and that allowing them to acquire land near military installations could pose a significant risk to national security.
Some key points about the national security implications include:
* The CCP has been known to use its economic influence to gain strategic advantages
* Allowing the Chinese government to acquire significant interests in Arizona real estate could pose a significant risk to national security
* Senator Rogers believes that the bill was a necessary precaution to protect Arizona's critical infrastructure and national security
The conversation also touched on the role of the Arizona legislature and the relationship between the legislative and executive branches. Senator Rogers noted that the legislative branch is the strongest branch of government, but that it requires cooperation and compromise to achieve common goals.
Some key points about the role of the Arizona legislature include:
* The Arizona legislature is controlled by Republicans, with 17 Republicans in the Arizona Senate and a two-vote majority in the state house
* Senator Rogers believes that the legislative branch is the strongest branch of government, but that it requires cooperation and compromise to achieve common goals
* The Arizona legislature plans to hold a vote to override Governor Hobbs' veto of Senate Bill 1109 in a couple of weeks
Overall, the conversation highlighted the ongoing debate over the role of the Chinese government in Arizona and the need for common-sense legislation to protect national security and critical infrastructure. Senator Rogers' argument emphasized the importance of prevention and the need for vigilance in the face of potential threats from the CCP.
