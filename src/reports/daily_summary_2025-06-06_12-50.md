### [Why is China BUYING so much land near US military bases? | Redaced w Clayton Morris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1K6v-yb_oDI)
*Redacted*  

Arizona Governor Katie Hobbs recently vetoed Senate Bill 1109, which aimed to prohibit the Chinese government and its state-owned enterprises from acquiring a 30% or greater interest in Arizona real estate. The bill was designed to safeguard critical infrastructure, including military installations like the Luke Air Force Base, from potential foreign espionage. 
Key points of the bill and its veto include:
* The bill was passed by the Arizona legislature, controlled by Republicans
* Governor Hobbs vetoed the bill, stating it was not effective at counter-espionage and lacked clear implementation criteria
* Governor Hobbs has vetoed over 200 bills, earning her the nickname "the veto queen"
* The veto has been met with criticism from Arizona State Senator Wendy Rogers, a former Air Force pilot who voted for the bill
Senator Rogers argues that prevention is key, and the bill was intended to prevent the Chinese government from acquiring land near military bases, which could be used for espionage. She points out that even if the Chinese government owns 30% of a property, they will still have a significant amount of control. 
Some of the key military installations in Arizona that could be affected by Chinese land ownership include:
* Luke Air Force Base
* Yuma proving ground
* Goldwater bombing range
* Fort Wuka, the Army's intelligence training center in southern Arizona
* A training area in northern Arizona
Senator Rogers also mentions that the veto is part of a larger pattern of Governor Hobbs' actions, which she believes are harmful to the state. She notes that the governor has vetoed many bills, including one that would have required hospitals to track the cost of treating illegal aliens.
The senator is optimistic that the veto can be overridden, and she plans to work with her colleagues to make that happen. She also mentions that US Congressman Andy Biggs is running to replace Governor Hobbs, which she sees as a positive development.
Some of the key points from Senator Rogers' conversation about the veto and its implications include:
* The importance of preventing Chinese ownership of land near military bases
* The need for the legislature to work together to override the governor's veto
* The potential consequences of allowing Chinese ownership of land in Arizona, including the risk of espionage and other security threats
* The role of Governor Hobbs in vetoing bills, including Senate Bill 1109
* The potential for Congressman Andy Biggs to replace Governor Hobbs and take a stronger stance on issues related to national security and Chinese ownership of land in Arizona
Senator Rogers can be followed on her website, wendyrogers.org, and on X, where she has over 400,000 followers. She encourages people to follow her and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in Arizona politics. Overall, the veto of Senate Bill 1109 is a significant issue, and Senator Rogers is working to raise awareness and push for action to protect Arizona's military installations and prevent Chinese ownership of land in the state.



### [[REACTION]  Gaza : 'The medical system - has been systematically dismantled'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsmiSh7dRh8)
*Judging Freedom*  

Dr. Fose Sidwa, an American trauma and critical care surgeon from Stockton, California, testified before the Security Council in New York about his experiences volunteering in the Gaza Strip. Key points from his testimony include:
* He has volunteered in Gaza twice since October 7th, and his patients were primarily civilians, including six-year-olds and pregnant women, who had been injured by shrapnels, bullets, and other forms of violence.
* During his 5 weeks in Gaza, he did not see or treat a single combatant, highlighting the disproportionate impact of the conflict on civilians.
* The medical system in Gaza has been "systematically dismantled" through a sustained military campaign that has willfully violated international humanitarian law.
* The consequences of this campaign are severe, with civilians dying from acute malnutrition, sepsis, exposure, and despair, in addition to direct injuries from air strikes.
* Dr. Sidwa emphasized that this is a "man-made catastrophe" that is entirely preventable, and that participating in or allowing it to happen is a choice.
* He also noted that preventing genocide requires refusing to normalize these atrocities and refusing to dehumanize the Palestinians.
* The conflict has brought about a "human dignity crisis" with an entire people on the edge of survival, and Dr. Sidwa urged that the only way to address this is to recognize the humanity of the Palestinians and to refuse to see them as mere statistics or objects.
The situation in Gaza has been supported by the United States, starting with the Biden administration and now continuing under the Trump administration, with the American taxpayer footing the bill. This has led to accusations that the US is complicit in a genocide, with the Israelis unable to execute their actions without US support. The scale of the crisis is vast, with the consequences of the conflict being felt deeply by the civilian population, and it is imperative that action is taken to address this crisis and prevent further atrocities from occurring.
