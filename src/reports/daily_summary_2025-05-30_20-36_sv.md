### 🚨🚨Will The WHOLE Group Go To Jail?- Watchmen Updates

*The Poplar Report*  

The host, Steve Popppler, opens the show by discussing various news updates, including a pause and then unpausing of tariffs, which is sending stock markets up and down in a rollercoaster ride. He also mentions that the FBI is now investigating Antifa for targeted attacks on Christians in Seattle, and that Madna has lost a major government contract.
Popppler then spends several minutes discussing the egg industry, revealing that 3.7 million egg layers have been culled in the last two weeks, with a significant number coming from Arizona, a Democratic stronghold state.

This development may lead to availability issues and price fluctuations in Arizona and surrounding states.
He also discusses the Federal Reserve's manipulation of the financial system for political purposes, and the potential consequences of this action. Additionally, he notes that President Trump has told the Federal Reserve chair that they made a huge mistake not cutting interest rates, and that the Chicago Fed president has stated that if tariffs are reduced, they would cut interest rates.
The host also touches on Chinese students being revoking visas, especially those linked to the Chinese Communist Party, and the cancellation of a $766 million Madna contract to fight future pandemics, including bird flu.
Several audience members share their personal experiences and concerns, including issues with steaks, cash and credit card transactions, and fraudulent medical billing practices.

### ⚠️ Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)

*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The transcript discusses the current economic situation, specifically the rising gold and silver prices, and the consequences of investors dumping US government bonds. The speaker emphasizes that another financial crisis is indeed occurring. The US government's inability to pay off its debt, combined with the fact that investors are selling bonds at a high interest rate, is contributing to the crisis.
The transcript highlights the following key points:
* The US government is struggling to pay off its debt due to low demand for bonds, leading to increased interest rates.
* The 30-year Treasury bond yield has risen above 5%, making it more expensive for borrowers to take out loans.
* This has led to a decrease in the value of the US dollar, causing inflation and potentially driving up prices.
* The speaker believes that if the US government continues to print more currency to fund its debt, it will eventually lead to a gold standard or a combination of assets, including Bitcoin, to stabilize the currency.
The transcript also discusses:
* The current state of global financial markets, where investors are seeking safe-haven assets such as gold and silver.
* The role of credit rating agencies, such as Moody's, in downgrading the US credit rating, which may lead to increased borrowing costs.
* The need for individuals to diversify their portfolios, including investing in tangible assets and physical gold and silver.
* The upcoming release of the speaker's new investment courses, which will focus on gold and silver investing.
The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of long-term investing and diversification, as well as the potential for the global financial system to transition away from fiat currencies and towards a more stable system.
Important numbers and statistics mentioned in the transcript include:
* $20 billion: the amount of bonds released by the US Treasury Department
* 5%: the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
* $3.5 trillion: the estimated amount of debt added to the US national debt over the next 10 years
* $50 trillion: the potential total amount of debt if the current trend continues
* 90%: the discount offered on the speaker's new investment courses
Causal links and correlations mentioned in the transcript include:
* The rise in gold and silver prices is attributed to the weakness of fiat currencies.
* The increase in bond yields is linked to the decreased demand for bonds and the government's struggling to pay off its debt.
* The decline in the value of the US dollar is expected to lead to increased prices and potentially drive up inflation.
* The need for individuals to diversify their portfolios is linked to the current economic uncertainty and potential for market volatility.
