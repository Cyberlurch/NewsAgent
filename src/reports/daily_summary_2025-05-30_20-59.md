### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

**Mistake 1: Focusing on Iconic Products**
* The speaker regrets not going for a more inconspicuous truck and winch design, instead of a flashy one that drew attention.
* Diesel vehicles are preferred for their ability to store diesel fuel, which is less volatile and longer-lasting.
* The speaker warns against focusing on iconography and instead recommends blending in.
**Mistake 2: Rushing into Decisions**
* The speaker has made decisions based on overly optimistic timelines, which did not materialize as expected.
* He cites the example of predicting a pandemic, which took longer to unfold than anticipated.
* He emphasizes the importance of taking a more realistic approach to decision-making.
**Mistake 3: Failing to Buy Land**
* The speaker regrets not buying land earlier, instead of waiting for the "perfect" property.
* He advises buying inexpensive land in areas that are not desirable to others, citing the principle "the least expensive thing now is going to be the most expensive thing after it hits the fan."
* Land with infrastructure (power lines, gas lines, telecoms lines, and roads) is considered a priority.
**Mistake 4: Believing in the Off-Grid Myth**

* He emphasizes the importance of taking courses and seeking expert advice to improve one's skills.
**Mistake 6: Having Too Much Gear and Not Being Organized**

**Final Thoughts**

### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

The speaker discusses three major stories related to geopolitics and World War III. The first story pertains to the supposed rift between the Pentagon and the Israeli military, with implications for their ongoing conflict with Iran. The speaker notes that Israel has been receiving a large shipment of weapons and claims that this is a sign of ongoing enabling by the US government.
The second story focuses on the increasing tension between Germany and Russia, with the Taus missile system being a major point of contention. Germany has declared that all restrictions on the use of NATO weaponry in Ukraine have been lifted, falling short of officially providing Ukraine with missile systems. The speaker notes that this move could lead to a full-blown conflict with Russia, and that Germany is trying to sidestep the issue by empowering Ukraine to construct its own long-range missile systems.
The third story revolves around the alleged leak of blueprints for Russia's secret nuclear bases. The leak, confirmed by German news agency Dash Spiegel, reveals sensitive information about Russia's nuclear program, including blueprints, security details, and missile silos. The speaker notes that this leak exposes a major vulnerability for Russia and could potentially give NATO an advantage in the event of a full-blown conflict.
The speaker raises several questions about the leak, including whether it was intentional or a case of bureaucratic mismanagement. They note that Russia has a history of leaking misleading information to throw NATO off the scent and that this leak could be a form of misdirection. However, they also argue that the leak is not necessarily damaging to Russia, as much of the information is already publicly available and the bunkers themselves could be in different locations than what is claimed.
The speaker discusses the possibility of this leak being a form of psychological operation or propaganda exercise, designed to distract from other issues or create a sense of crisis. They also note that the leak could be a sign of internal rivalries or power struggles within the Russian government, as Putin's image could be boosted by an apparent display of strength.
Overall, the speaker argues that this leak is a major development in the lead-up to World War III, as it exposes Russia's nuclear vulnerabilities and could potentially give NATO an advantage in the event of a conflict. They also note that the leak could be a sign of a larger game being played by the US and NATO, designed to create a sense of crisis and distract from other issues.



### [üö®üö®China Totally Violated Agreement- Here It Comes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8oEJdkpqf4)
*The Poplar Report*  

The speaker, Steve Popppler, discusses the current situation between the United States and China regarding tariffs and trade agreements. He notes that the recent truce between the two nations has imploded, and China has not upheld its end of the bargain. Popppler claims that China has been violating the agreement by not opening up its rare earth minerals for export to the United States and Europe, which are critical components in the production of weapons and military equipment.
The speaker argues that China's actions are a form of economic warfare, designed to harm the United States and prevent it from building its military capabilities. He notes that China has imposed tariffs on plastic products from the United States and European countries, which is a violation of the agreement. Popppler also mentions that the United States has imposed an export ban on critical components to jet engines, which will prevent China from building its own jet engines.
Popppler claims that President Trump was correct in backing off on the harsh tariffs imposed on China, as China was in a state of economic crisis and civil unrest. However, China has not acted in good faith, continuing to take advantage of the United States. He notes that the European Union has also been taking advantage of the United States, and that the current trade agreements are not fair.
The speaker argues that the United States needs to crack down on China and stop being taken advantage of. He notes that the country is being subsidized by its economic allies, who are using the US dollar as their own currency. Popppler claims that if the US stops printing money and starts to manufacture its own products, the global economy will change.
The conversation also touches on the idea that automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will soon replace many office jobs, and that the United States is not immune to this trend. Popppler notes that the US is already seeing companies lay off employees and replace them with automated systems.

### [‚ö†Ô∏è Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyoljrgDJY)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The speaker discusses the current state of the economy and the rising gold and silver prices. He believes that a financial crisis is imminent and that investors are dumping bonds, including US government bonds, due to concerns about the creditworthiness of the US and other fiat currencies. The speaker attributes this to the debt spiral, where governments are printing more money to pay the interest on their debts, causing the value of the currency to weaken.
The speaker mentions the "Sell America" trend, where investors are selling US government bonds, and notes that this trend is being driven by China, Russia, and other BRICS nations as part of a strategic alliance against the US dollar. He believes that this trend will lead to a higher interest rate on US government bonds, making debt more expensive for individuals.
The speaker also discusses the downgrading of the US credit rating by Moody's, which he believes is a serious warning sign. He notes that this is not a isolated event and that other credit rating agencies have also downgraded the US credit rating.
The speaker recommends physical assets, such as gold and silver, as a way to protect oneself from the coming financial crisis. He believes that tangible assets will retain their value over time, and that gold and silver have been a store of value for thousands of years.
The speaker also discusses the concept of a debt spiral, where governments are creating more money to pay the interest on their debts, causing the value of the currency to weaken. He believes that this will lead to inflation and eventually a central bank digital currency (CBDC).
The speaker recommends diversification and a long-term perspective when it comes to investing in physical assets. He believes that over the long term, metal prices will go up and that gold and silver are a good investment.
Finally, the speaker announces a massive discount on his new investment courses, which he believes will help individuals prepare for the coming financial crisis. He is offering 90% off the courses, which will include 10-15 videos every weekend and some free bonus materials, such as video modules and PDF downloads.
