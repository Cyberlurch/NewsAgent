## PREPAREDNESS

### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The speaker shares their personal experiences and mistakes as a prepper, highlighting five key takeaways:
‚Ä¢ **Iconic vs. Obscure**: The speaker reflects on their mistake of having an overly decked-out truck, which drew attention to their prepping activities. They recommend focusing on obscurity, blending in, and acquiring a diesel vehicle, which is less likely to be phased out.
‚Ä¢ **Rushing**: The speaker notes their tendency to rush into decisions, which often led to incorrect conclusions. They advise taking a more realistic approach, understanding that things may take longer to unfold than initially expected.
‚Ä¢ **Buying Land**: The speaker regrets not buying land earlier, especially in areas with minimal infrastructure. They recommend purchasing a cheap piece of land as a starting point, which will likely maintain value even if things go wrong.
‚Ä¢ **Off-Grid Myth**: The speaker questions the idea of being entirely off-grid, citing the need for certain resources and the misconception that it will be simpler. They suggest understanding the challenges and sacrifices involved in off-grid living.
‚Ä¢ **Skills and Organization**: The speaker acknowledges their lack of focus on developing skills and staying organized. They advise prioritizing skills, such as survival and first aid, and limiting gear acquisition to focus on a few, reliable tools rather than accumulating a large collection.
Some additional points:
‚Ä¢ The speaker mentions that diesel vehicles are being phased out, possibly due to their empowering nature.
‚Ä¢ They note that wealthy preppers are buying land in unappealing areas, which will maintain its value in a worst-case scenario.
‚Ä¢ The speaker contrasts the idea of having a nice, mountainous property (like Curtis Stone's) with the reality of prepping, which often requires a more obscure, off-the-beaten-path location.
‚Ä¢ They emphasize the importance of having a skilled trade and taking courses to develop expertise in various areas.
‚Ä¢ The speaker suggests that individualism and a "keeping up with the Joneses" mindset can hinder prepping progress, and encourages building relationships and learning from others.
‚Ä¢ They conclude by encouraging viewers to share their own prepping mistakes and successes in the comments section.



### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

Three major stories regarding the possibility of World War III being discussed:
1. **Pentagon-Israeli Military Rift**: The analyst suggests that the rift between the Pentagon and the Israeli military may be real, citing the ongoing shipment of weapons to Israel. The analyst warns that where the weapons flow, the truth will follow, and that Israel's ability to engage in a full-on conflict in the region, especially with Iran, is concerning.
2. **Germany-Russia Tensions**: Tensions are increasing between Germany and Russia, with the latter threatening a direct strike on NATO assets in Brussels or Germany if the former provides advanced missile systems to Ukraine. Germany is trying to bypass this issue by empowering Ukraine to construct its own long-range missile systems, which could be used against Russia. Russia has been targeting facilities where these systems are constructed, leading to a significant exchange of fire.
3. **Alleged Leak of Russian Nuclear Bases' Blueprints**: A confirmed leak of blueprints for Russia's secret nuclear bases has been released online. The leak includes 2 million documents exposing Russia's nuclear program, including 3D renderings of facilities, security details, and nuclear missile systems. The analyst wonders if this was an intentional leak for subtrafuge and misdirection, or simply a bureaucratic mistake. The leak could potentially provide NATO with an advantage in a full-on war with Russia, despite Russia's best efforts to maintain secrecy.
Key points:
* 2 million documents exposing Russia's nuclear program were leaked online
* The leak includes blueprints for Russia's secret nuclear bases
* Russia has a disadvantage in full-on war with Russia due to NATO's ability to surround them and collect data through Ukrainian drone strikes
* The leak could provide NATO with an edge in a war with Russia
* The analyst questions whether the leak was intentional or a mistake
* The leak could be used for subtrafuge and misdirection, potentially drawing NATO's attention away from real facilities
* The Russian government's handling of the leak is likely to be embarrassing and could damage its reputation
The analyst concludes that the leak is significant and could potentially impact the global balance of power. The discussion highlights the increasing tensions between nations and the potential for war to break out at any moment. The analyst suggests that the information in the leak could be used for various purposes, including psychological operations and propaganda exercises.
