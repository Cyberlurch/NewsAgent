## PREPAREDNESS

### [⚡A HISTORIC Event is Happening: Prepare Your Escape Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhmg5ZogQhk)
*Canadian Prepper*  

The current situation in North America, particularly in the Canadian boreal forest, is experiencing a significant surge in fires, with thousands potentially needing to evacuate. The premier has stated that this is unprecedented, and it could be one of the largest fires in North American history. Key points to consider include:
* 70% of the continent is forested, making a large portion of the population vulnerable to fires.
* The fire is moving at a rate of 400 meters per day, despite winds blowing in the opposite direction.
* The fire is nearly a thousand square kilometers in size, close to the size of Prince Elbert National Park.
* The fire is expected to get worse, with above-average temperatures forecasted for British Columbia.
* The fire is not just a local issue, as it can have far-reaching effects on the environment, including air quality and temperature regulation.
Some key tools for tracking fires and preparedness include:
* firesmoke.ca: a website that tracks fire smoke and air quality.
* fire map live: a website that shows the size of the area burned.
* zoom earth: a website that provides real-time satellite feeds of the fire.
* climate reanalyzer: a website that provides forecasting and meteorological data.
In terms of evacuation, it's essential to have a plan and be prepared. Some key considerations include:
* Having a bugout plan in place, including a safe route and a means of communication.
* Being aware of the fire's trajectory and wind direction.
* Having a reference and identification portfolio (RIP kit) with important documents and identification.
* Having a means of protecting oneself from smoke and ash, such as a fire mask.
The speaker also discusses the importance of being prepared for emergencies, including having a plan, being aware of one's surroundings, and having the necessary tools and equipment. Some key statistics and facts mentioned include:
* Gas stations only hold 2-3 days' worth of gasoline.
* Grocery stores stock typically runs out in a few hours.
* Cell towers and internet have limited capacity, and emergency services may be overwhelmed.
* Banks and ATMs will be drained quickly, and cash may become the only accepted form of payment.
* Water supply requires electricity, and sanitation and garbage pickup may be disrupted.
* The power grid is aging and fragile, and a single cyber attack or storm could bring it down.
* Medical supplies are limited, and pharmacies only carry a few days' worth of medication.
* Ammunition will likely run out in 24 hours.
* Law enforcement is limited, with only one cop for every 1,000 people.
* Hospitals are not designed to handle surge capacity and may become overwhelmed.
Overall, the situation is serious, and it's essential to be prepared and have a plan in place. The speaker encourages viewers to watch videos on preparedness and evacuation, including "Every Prepper Needs a RIP Kit" and "24 Hours to Chaos."

In other news, Elon Musk has sparked a civil war within the Republican party by criticizing the big spending bill, which would add trillions of dollars to the US deficit. Musk stated that bankrupting America is not okay, and many people agree with him. The US government debt is a significant concern, and when it suddenly matters, it could have severe consequences, including:

## CHRISTIANITY

### [Explore the Bible: Read Your Bible to Understand It (Part II)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEzCXQ_8rU4)
*Behold Israel*  

Air Tati and Dr. Rick Yon discuss the importance of observing and understanding the Bible, starting with a prayer to seek guidance from God. They then dive into John 1:12, which states, "But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in his name." Dr. Rick Yon notes that the word "but" is used to contrast with a previous statement, and in this case, it contrasts with the fact that Jesus' own people did not receive him. 
To understand who Jesus is, they go back to John 1:1, which states, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." This verse establishes that Jesus is the Word, the Logos, and is God. Dr. Rick Yon also refers to John 1:14, which says, "And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth."
The discussion then shifts to the meaning of "believe" in John 1:12. Air Tati notes that believing is not just mental assent, but receiving Jesus into one's life. Dr. Rick Yon agrees, stating that to believe is to receive, and this is an active part of becoming a child of God. 
Some key points from the discussion include:
* The importance of observing and understanding the Bible
* The meaning of John 1:12 and the concept of receiving Jesus as a child of God
* The significance of the word "but" in contrasting with previous statements
* The establishment of Jesus as the Word, the Logos, and God in John 1:1
* The meaning of "believe" as receiving Jesus into one's life
They also explore John 3:16, which says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." Dr. Rick Yon notes that the word "for" is used to clarify something that came before, and in this case, it refers to the conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus. 
The conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus is discussed, including Jesus' statement that one must be born again to see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus is puzzled by this, and Jesus explains that being born of the spirit is necessary to enter the kingdom of God. 
The discussion then turns to Numbers 21:4-9, which tells the story of the Israelites being bitten by fiery serpents in the wilderness. Moses prays for the people, and God provides a remedy by instructing Moses to create a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. Those who look at the serpent will live, while those who do not will die. 
Dr. Rick Yon draws a parallel between this story and John 3:16, noting that just as the Israelites had to look at the bronze serpent to be saved, we must look to Jesus to be saved. The act of looking is an act of faith, and it is this faith that saves us. 
Some key points from this part of the discussion include:
* The conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus
* The importance of being born again to see the kingdom of God
* The story of the Israelites and the bronze serpent in Numbers 21:4-9
* The parallel between looking at the bronze serpent and looking to Jesus for salvation
* The importance of faith in salvation
The episode concludes with Air Tati expressing his hope that the discussion will minister to both believers and non-believers, and that it will help people understand the simplicity of faith and the importance of looking to Jesus for salvation. Dr. Rick Yon is thanked for his exposition, and the audience is invited to visit the Behold Israel website for more resources and to ask questions. 
Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of observing and understanding the Bible, and the simplicity of faith in salvation. It highlights the significance of Jesus as the Word, the Logos, and God, and the importance of receiving him into one's life. The parallel between the story of the bronze serpent and John 3:16 is also emphasized, and the importance of faith in salvation is stressed. 
Key takeaways from the episode include:
* The importance of observing and understanding the Bible
* The simplicity of faith in salvation
* The significance of Jesus as the Word, the Logos, and God
* The importance of receiving Jesus into one's life
* The parallel between the story of the bronze serpent and John 3:16

* John 1:1
* John 1:12

### ['Big Beautiful Bill' Faces Uncertain Future in Senate, Trump Agrees With 'Nemesis' On Debt Limit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9dFA34SlOk)
*CBN News*  

Key stakeholders are working to advance President Trump's bill through the Senate, after it has already passed the House. The goal is to get the bill to the president's desk by July 4th. To achieve this, the following points are noteworthy:
* Republicans can only afford to lose three votes in the Senate, making it crucial to secure enough support for the bill.
* Some GOP members, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren's colleagues, are demanding changes to the bill, citing concerns about accumulating more debt.
* A new analysis from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the proposed legislation would:
  + Add $2.4 trillion to the deficit over the next decade.
  + Result in approximately 11 million people losing health insurance coverage due to changes to programs like Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act tax credits.
* Senate Republicans met with Trump at the White House to discuss deeper spending cuts of up to $2 trillion, while also strengthening Medicaid.
* President Trump's former ally, Elon Musk, is a fierce critic of the bill, urging his over 200 million followers to call members of Congress to have them kill the bill, which he dubbed the "debt slavery bill".
* House Speaker Mike Johnson had a conversation with Musk earlier in the week and expressed surprise at his criticism, stating that he thinks Musk is "flat wrong" and "way off" on this issue.
* The bill cuts the electric vehicle tax credit, which could be a point of self-interest for Musk.
* In a surprise move, President Trump announced that he agrees with Senator Elizabeth Warren on getting rid of the debt limit, stating that it should be entirely scrapped to prevent an economic catastrophe.
* Any changes to the bill in the Senate would restart negotiations in the House, making it essential to secure a version that can pass both chambers.
* The deadline to get the bill to President Trump's desk is July 4th, and failure is not considered an option by key stakeholders, including President Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson.

### [SHAME ON YOU! Elon Musk SLAMS Trump's 'Big Beautiful Bill' as 'disgusting' | Redacted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVFuzKeJp9Q)
*Redacted*  

President Trump is pushing to pass a big, beautiful spending bill by July 4th, but some Republicans and Elon Musk are opposing it. Elon Musk, the head of Doge, posted on social media, saying the bill is a "disgusting abomination" and "pork-filled." He encouraged people to ask their congressmen and senators why they are voting for it and if they have read it thoroughly. Musk is concerned about the debt it will add to the national deficit, which is currently $36.2 trillion. 
Some of the key points of the bill include:
* Adding trillions of dollars to the national debt
* Increasing spending on various programs, including entitlement programs and welfare programs
* Increasing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, which is seen as a handout to high-income individuals in high-tax municipalities
* Introducing stricter requirements to receive Medicaid, which has been mischaracterized by Democrats as an attempt to get rid of the program
EJ Antony, a research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, discussed the bill and its implications. He noted that:
* The national debt is a significant problem that is getting worse quickly, with the debt ceiling being lifted and the Treasury going on a massive borrowing spree to replenish its cash account
* The bill is not a great solution, but it may be better than doing nothing, which would result in significant tax increases on the middle class over the next decade, totaling around $4.5 trillion
* The Republicans in Congress are facing opposition from Democrats, who will give them zero help on anything, forcing them to use reconciliation and recisions to get things done
* The bill can be improved by making big cuts, such as tightening restrictions on entitlement programs and welfare programs to reduce abuse, corruption, and waste
Some potential big cuts that can be made include:
* Tightening restrictions on entitlement programs, such as Social Security and Medicaid, to reduce illegitimate payments and prolong the solvency of these programs
* Reducing the cap on the SALT deduction, which is seen as a handout to high-income individuals in high-tax municipalities
* Introducing stricter requirements to receive Medicaid, which would help to reduce abuse and waste in the program
Antony also addressed the Democratic talking point that the bill will get rid of Medicaid, saying that it is not true and that the bill would actually increase Medicaid spending, but at a slightly slower rate than before. He noted that the bill would remove illegal aliens from the program, which is a change that Democrats are opposing despite previously saying that illegal aliens are not eligible for welfare programs. 
Overall, the bill is a complex issue with many different perspectives and potential outcomes. While some, like President Trump, see it as a necessary step to avoid significant tax increases, others, like Elon Musk and EJ Antony, are concerned about the debt it will add to the national deficit and the potential for abuse and waste in various programs. The bill is likely to undergo revisions in the Senate, but it is unclear what the final outcome will be. 
In the end, the fate of the bill remains uncertain, with many different factors at play. However, one thing is clear: the national debt is a significant problem that needs to be addressed, and any solution will require careful consideration of the potential consequences and trade-offs. As EJ Antony noted, the bill is not a clean carbon copy of the House bill, and it is likely to undergo revisions in the Senate. The final outcome will depend on the negotiations and compromises made by the different parties involved. 
The key players in this issue include:
* President Trump, who is pushing to pass the bill by July 4th
* Elon Musk, who is opposing the bill and encouraging people to ask their congressmen and senators about it
* EJ Antony, who is providing analysis and commentary on the bill and its implications
* Democrats, who are opposing the bill and characterizing it as an attempt to get rid of Medicaid
* Republicans, who are trying to pass the bill and make revisions to address the concerns of their constituents. 
The key numbers involved in this issue include:
* $36.2 trillion: the current national debt
* $4.5 trillion: the total tax increases on the middle class over the next decade if nothing is done
* $38 trillion: the projected national debt by September if the debt ceiling is lifted and the Treasury goes on a massive borrowing spree. 
Overall, the bill is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration of the potential consequences and trade-offs. As the negotiations and debates continue, it is likely that the bill will undergo significant revisions and changes before it is finally passed.



### [[REACTION]  Gaza : 'The medical system - has been systematically dismantled'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsmiSh7dRh8)
*Judging Freedom*  

Dr. Fose Sidwa, an American trauma and critical care surgeon from Stockton, California, testified before the Security Council about his experiences volunteering in the Gaza Strip. Key points from his testimony include:
* He has volunteered in Gaza twice since October 7th, and his patients included:

  + Pregnant women whose pelvises had been obliterated and their fetuses cut in two while still in the womb
* During his 5 weeks in Gaza, he did not see or treat a single combatant

* Civilians are dying from:
  + Constant air strikes
  + Acute malnutrition
  + Sepsis
  + Exposure
  + Despair
* Dr. Sidwa emphasized that this is a man-made catastrophe that is entirely preventable, and that participating in it or allowing it to happen is a choice
* He stated that preventing genocide means refusing to normalize these atrocities and refusing to dehumanize the Palestinians
* The situation in Gaza has brought about a human dignity crisis, with an entire people on the edge of survival
The testimony was followed by a discussion about the involvement of the United States in the conflict, with the speaker stating that:
* The actions of the Israelis could not be executed without the support of the United States
* The situation is "complicit in a genocide" that is paid for by the American taxpayer
* The Biden administration and now the Trump administration have supported the actions of the Israelis
The speaker noted that the testimony of Dr. Sidwa is "merely the tip of the iceberg" and that the conflict is "absolutely horrific" and "hard to believe" that it has not been stopped, and that the United States is involved in executing it.
