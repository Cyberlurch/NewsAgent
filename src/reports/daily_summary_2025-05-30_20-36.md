## PREPAREDNESS

### [5 Prepping Mistakes You Can Avoid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKP3vh0lpk0)
*Canadian Prepper*  

**Mistakes Made as a Prepper**
* Focusing on iconography and showcasing high-end gear instead of obscurity and simplicity. A prepper's goal should be to blend in and avoid drawing attention to themselves.
* Rushing into decisions and not considering the long-term consequences. A prepper should be patient and realistic about the timeline of events.
* Believing in the off-grid myth and expecting to be self-sufficient without sacrificing convenience. Off-grid living requires a lot of work, and it's essential to understand the challenges involved.
* Not focusing on skills and education. A prepper should prioritize acquiring new skills and taking courses in areas such as survival, first aid, and self-defense.
* Being too focused on gear and not being organized. It's essential to master a few essential tools and stick with them instead of constantly collecting new gear.
**Additional Insights**
* Diesel vehicles are a good investment due to their ability to store fuel and be used for various equipment. They are also more durable and less volatile than gasoline.
* Acquiring a piece of land is essential for prepping. Look for inexpensive, low-demand areas with minimal infrastructure.
* Having a plan and being prepared for a crisis is crucial. It's essential to prioritize what's truly important and avoid getting caught up in the hype.
* Transparency is key. Share your mistakes and what you've learned from them to help others.
**Personal Reflections**
* The speaker's YouTube channel has been a significant influence on their decisions and has led to a tendency to focus on high-end gear and iconography.
* The speaker has learned to recalibrate their understanding of timelines and events, realizing that predictions are often wrong and that the process of collapse is slower and more drawn out than expected.
* The speaker regrets their focus on off-grid living and the sacrifices and challenges that come with it.



### [‚ö°Alert: Russian Nuclear Base HISTORIC Data Leak! 2 Million Documents Reveal WW3 Bunker Secrets!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJwpfAraOQA)
*Prepper News Flash*  

The analyst discusses three major stories related to geopolitics and potential conflict. The first story pertains to the supposed rift between the Pentagon and the Israeli military. The analyst believes that Israel is being enabled to engage in a conflict with Iran and notes that the flow of weapons can reveal the truth about a country's agenda.
The second story involves increasing tension between Germany and Russia, with Germany allowing Ukraine to construct long-range missile systems that can potentially bypass Russian air defenses. The analyst notes that this move could lead to a direct strike on NATO assets and warns that Russia has threatened to target facilities where these missile systems are being constructed.
The third story involves a leak of blueprints of Russia's secret nuclear bases, including information on nuclear missile programs and security systems. The analyst notes that this leak could potentially give NATO an advantage and create a vulnerability for Russia. The leak includes 3D renderings of facilities, security details, and information on missiles and bunkers.
The analyst discusses the potential significance of this leak, noting that it could provide NATO with an edge in a potential conflict with Russia. They also suggest that this leak could be a form of subterfuge and misdirection, potentially used to distract from real facilities or create false data to mislead people.
The analyst also notes that the leak could be an embarrassment for Russia, particularly if the leak is perceived as bureaucratic negligence. They suggest that the leak could also be used to boost Putin's image and target internal rivals.
The analyst argues that there are arguments for and against this being an intentional leak, noting that the leak includes too sensitive information to be credible as a leak of bureaucratic incompetency. They also suggest that the leak could be a propaganda exercise or psychological operation, designed to create a certain level of fear or uncertainty among the Russian people.
Finally, the analyst notes that the leak could be revealing Russia's major nuclear upgrades and exposing vulnerabilities that could potentially be used by war planners. They suggest that the leak could contribute to Russia's decline and increase the likelihood of war.

*The Poplar Report*  

The host, Steve Popppler, opens the show by discussing various news updates, including a pause and then unpausing of tariffs, which is sending stock markets up and down in a rollercoaster ride. He also mentions that the FBI is now investigating Antifa for targeted attacks on Christians in Seattle, and that Madna has lost a major government contract.
Popppler then spends several minutes discussing the egg industry, revealing that 3.7 million egg layers have been culled in the last two weeks, with a significant number coming from Arizona, a Democratic stronghold state.

This development may lead to availability issues and price fluctuations in Arizona and surrounding states.
He also discusses the Federal Reserve's manipulation of the financial system for political purposes, and the potential consequences of this action. Additionally, he notes that President Trump has told the Federal Reserve chair that they made a huge mistake not cutting interest rates, and that the Chicago Fed president has stated that if tariffs are reduced, they would cut interest rates.
The host also touches on Chinese students being revoking visas, especially those linked to the Chinese Communist Party, and the cancellation of a $766 million Madna contract to fight future pandemics, including bird flu.
Several audience members share their personal experiences and concerns, including issues with steaks, cash and credit card transactions, and fraudulent medical billing practices.

### [‚ö†Ô∏è Investors DUMPING Bonds Like Crazy As Gold & Silver Prices Rise (Financial CRISIS Here!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOyoljrgDJY)
*Neil McCoy Ward*  

The transcript discusses the current economic situation, specifically the rising gold and silver prices, and the consequences of investors dumping US government bonds. The speaker emphasizes that another financial crisis is indeed occurring. The US government's inability to pay off its debt, combined with the fact that investors are selling bonds at a high interest rate, is contributing to the crisis.
The transcript highlights the following key points:
* The US government is struggling to pay off its debt due to low demand for bonds, leading to increased interest rates.
* The 30-year Treasury bond yield has risen above 5%, making it more expensive for borrowers to take out loans.
* This has led to a decrease in the value of the US dollar, causing inflation and potentially driving up prices.
* The speaker believes that if the US government continues to print more currency to fund its debt, it will eventually lead to a gold standard or a combination of assets, including Bitcoin, to stabilize the currency.
The transcript also discusses:
* The current state of global financial markets, where investors are seeking safe-haven assets such as gold and silver.
* The role of credit rating agencies, such as Moody's, in downgrading the US credit rating, which may lead to increased borrowing costs.
* The need for individuals to diversify their portfolios, including investing in tangible assets and physical gold and silver.
* The upcoming release of the speaker's new investment courses, which will focus on gold and silver investing.
The speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of long-term investing and diversification, as well as the potential for the global financial system to transition away from fiat currencies and towards a more stable system.
Important numbers and statistics mentioned in the transcript include:
* $20 billion: the amount of bonds released by the US Treasury Department
* 5%: the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
* $3.5 trillion: the estimated amount of debt added to the US national debt over the next 10 years
* $50 trillion: the potential total amount of debt if the current trend continues
* 90%: the discount offered on the speaker's new investment courses
Causal links and correlations mentioned in the transcript include:
* The rise in gold and silver prices is attributed to the weakness of fiat currencies.
* The increase in bond yields is linked to the decreased demand for bonds and the government's struggling to pay off its debt.
* The decline in the value of the US dollar is expected to lead to increased prices and potentially drive up inflation.
* The need for individuals to diversify their portfolios is linked to the current economic uncertainty and potential for market volatility.
