The speaker, a YouTuber known as the Canadian Prepper, is announcing that they will no longer be creating alert videos, daily intel briefs, and geopolitical content on their current channel. Instead, they will be moving all of this content to a new channel called Prepper News. The reason for this change is that the two types of content (practical preparedness and intel briefs) were counteracting each other, and YouTube's algorithm was not allowing them to grow. The new channel will focus on risk mitigation and providing accurate intel, while the Canadian Prepper channel will be more "vanilla" and focused on practical preparedness, gear reviews, and interviews. The speaker encourages subscribers to follow them to the new channel, where they will be able to provide more in-depth and potentially more controversial content.
