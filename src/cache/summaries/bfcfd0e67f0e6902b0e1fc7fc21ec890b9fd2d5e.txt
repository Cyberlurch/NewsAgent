Here is a summary of the transcript:

The speaker is shocked and impressed by Bernie Sanders' recent statements, which they believe are long overdue. Sanders is criticizing the Democratic establishment for being funded by wealthy people and ignoring the working class. The speaker agrees that the Democratic party has lost touch with reality and has been lying about the state of the economy and crime statistics. They believe that Sanders was sabotaged by the Democratic establishment in 2016 and that he was right to push for truth and reform. However, the speaker is frustrated that Sanders continued to support the Democratic party despite being betrayed multiple times. The conversation also touches on the idea that the Democratic establishment is corrupt and has been rigging elections since 2008, and that they don't care about the working class. The speaker is glad that Sanders is finally speaking out against the establishment, but is disappointed that it took him so long to do so.
