[Music] Berlin is a city once divided by walls. This week, Christian leaders from across Europe gathered under one roof, united by one mission. The gospel has power. We're going to reach Europe. We need an army. An army of evangelists, unafraid, unashamed, unapologetic, uncompromising. At Berlin's JW Marriott, national flags line the walls. And at the center of it all, a single cross illuminating what's being called Europe's most significant spiritual gathering since Amsterdam in 2000. And a return to the city where Billy Graham launched his global mission in 1966. The city of Berlin has influenced the world in every field. What a place from which to shout to the world, Christ is the savior. The mission comes as churches close across Europe. Franklin Graham told CBN News nearly 1,000 churches in Germany closed their doors last year alone. He challenged pastors to stand firm and move forward. And pastors are responding to that call. We have a big job in front of us to reach this generation. Worship leaders, speakers, and believers came from 57 countries, including Ukraine and Russia, where war still rages. Yet here they stood side by side, united in the gospel. We want to ignite a fire uh in Europe where there's an excitement for evangelism. The churches are are willing to be bold and not ashamed of the gospel. We've got Ukrainian churches coming. We have churches coming from Russia. You know, he said these countries are at war. Yes, they are. But the gospel is more powerful than any of that stuff. With a renewed mission and shared vision, these church leaders now return home, ready to share the good news throughout Europe.
