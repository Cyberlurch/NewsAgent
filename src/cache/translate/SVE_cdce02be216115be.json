Our prepper friend joins us today and we're excited to have Gardening in Canada as our guest to assess the garden and provide guidance.\n\n**Assessing the Garden**\n\nGardening in Canada: I must say, the garden looks good, but there are a few areas we can improve. One key aspect is spacing. The crops are too close together; it will hinder growth and lead to issues with disease and pests.\n\n**Soil Quality and Preparation**\nThe soil quality is also a concern. We need to use high-quality soil and properly prepare it for planting. This includes mixing in organic matter such as compost or manure to ensure optimal nutrient levels.\n\n### **Irrigation Systems: Maximizing Efficiency**\n\nTo maximize water efficiency, we need a well-designed irrigation system. Direct drippers and sprayers will help minimize waste and ensure the right amount of water reaches each plant.\n\n### **Pest Management: Natural Methods**\nA key challenge in gardening is pest management. Instead of using chemicals, we can introduce beneficial insects like lady beetles or lacewings to control aphids and other pests.\n\n### **Crop Selection: Choosing Well-Suited Crops**\n\nIt's essential to select crops that are well-suited to our local climate and growing conditions. For example, in Zone 3, we should choose varieties that mature quickly and are resistant to frost.\n\n**Crop-Specific Guidance**\n\n* **Peppers: Proper Spacing and Irrigation**\nProper spacing (about 12 inches apart) and irrigation will promote healthy growth and maximize yields. Bees and other pollinators help, so keep flowers nearby.\n```markdown\n# peppers\n## spacing\n  * 12 inches apart for maximum growth\n## irrigation\n  * adequate moisture, but not too much\n```\n\n* **Tomatoes: Providing Support**\nTomatoes need proper support, like cages or trellises. Regular pruning will promote healthy growth and increase yields.\n\n```markdown\n# tomatoes\n## support\n  * cages or trellises for sturdy plants\n## pruning\n  * regular pruning to promote growth\n```\n\n* **Cucumbers: Sensitive Plants**\nCucumbers can be sensitive to transplanting, so handle them gently. Provide proper support, as they can grow quite large.\n\n```markdown\n# cucumbers\n## transplantation\n  * handle with care\n## support\n  * provide sturdy support for climbing plants\n```\n\n* **Fruit Trees: Selecting Well-Suited Trees**\nChoose fruit trees suitable for our local climate and growing conditions. Proper care and maintenance, including pruning, will ensure a healthy and productive tree.\n\n```markdown\n# fruit trees\n## selection\n  * choose varieties resistant to local pests and diseases\n## care and maintenance\n  * regular pruning to promote growth\n```\n\n**Preparing for a Potential Apocalypse**\n\nIt's essential to be prepared for a potential apocalypse by having a long-term plan for food production and sustainability. Gardening in Canada emphasizes the importance of taking the time to learn and practice gardening skills and seeking out expert guidance and advice.\n\n**Key Statistics**\n\n* Gardening in Canada YouTube channel: 1.33 million subscribers\n* Hardiness Zone: Zone 3\n* Greenhouse microclimate: Zone 4 or 5 (warmer than the surrounding area)\n* Transplantation time: 2 weeks\n* Onion plant rating: 10 out of 10\n\nI hope this detailed conversation has provided valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities of gardening and food production. By following expert guidance like Gardening in Canada, we can ensure a successful harvest and a sustainable future.\n\n<font size=\"5\" color=\"red\">[ALERT: Something Isn't Right here... the War is About to Explode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeTRL0jbbE0)</font>\n*Prepper News Flash*\n\n**Global Tensions Escalate: Analyzing the Conflict between Russia, Ukraine, and the Impending Risk of World War III**\n\n### Key Points\n\n* Russia's Crimean Bridge was the target of a Ukrainian attack, which received minimal attention in mainstream and alternative media due to systematic desensitization to the conflict.\n* Russia is facing multiple attacks, including assassination attempts, strikes on nuclear power plants, and the decimation of their nuclear triad, which could lead to a significant escalation.\n* The West's multidimensional war on Russia involves economic sanctions, attacks on critical infrastructure, and psychological operations.\n* Vladimir Putin's situation is being backed into a corner, limiting his options and potentially forcing him to consider using nuclear weapons.\n\n### Russia's Strategic Disadvantage\n\n* The US has a significant advantage in terms of its aviational component of its nuclear triad, with a larger air force and more bombers, which could be used to attack Russia.\n\n### Psychological Operations and Asymmetrical Warfare\n\n* Putin must balance his need to respond to Western aggression with the risk of escalating the conflict to a nuclear war.\n* The global south, including China, may be sympathetic to Russia's position, but the West is trying to isolate Russia and paint it as a pariah state.\n* Asymmetrical warfare, cognitive misers, and protocol-based thinking are strategies being employed, while the use of forest fires as a weapon and biological warfare are potential tactics.\n\n### Key Events and Numbers\n\n* The attempted attack on the Crimean Bridge\n* The assassination attempt on Vladimir Putin's helicopter\n* The destruction of 7-41 Russian planes\n* The attack on the Russian nuclear triad\n* The attacks on nuclear power plants and critical infrastructure\n* The production of drones by Ukraine, which is increasing\n\n### Global South's Perspective\n\n* China may be sympathetic to Russia's position, but the West is trying to isolate Russia and paint it as a pariah state.\n\n### Mobilization and Exercises\n\n* The US is mobilizing its military, with unconventional training methods being practiced, and NATO is holding large-scale nuclear war exercises, which could be a sign of an impending conflict.\n* The situation is being downplayed by some analysts, who may be operatives or have a vested interest in minimizing the risk of war.\n\n### Biological Warfare Risks\n\n* The Fuzerium grammanium biological pathogen was smuggled into the US, potentially threatening national security and the risk of biological warfare.\n* This incident highlights the importance of monitoring and mitigating asymmetrical threats.\n\n### Key Players and Concepts\n\n* Major players: Vladimir Putin, Donald Trump, Tucker Carlson, Jamal Thomas, Scott Ritter, Sergey Karagenov, Zalinsky, and Joe Biden\n* Concepts: Asymmetrical warfare, cognitive misers, protocol-based thinking, true analytical thinking, and the use of research institutions as front ops for gathering data and testing biological agents.\n\n### Implications and Consequences\n\n* The Russian economy is being targeted by the West, with sanctions and attempts to crash the price of oil.\n* The potential for a nuclear war is being underestimated, and the consequences of such a war would be catastrophic, including devastating impacts on the environment and human populations.\n\n[\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Multiple WARNINGS Ignored - & Watchmen Updates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOaua-b_n0M)\n\n*The Poplar Report*\n\nThe Popppler Report\n=================\n### Show Description\n\nThe Popppler Report, hosted by Steve Popppler, is a show that provides updates on various topics, including trade, economy, and current events.

In John 1:12, we have \"But as many as received him, to them he gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in his name.\" We need to identify the who, what, where, and why in this verse.\n\n**Exploring John 1:12**\n\n* Dr. Yon: The word \"but\" in this verse indicates a contrast, implying that there is something being contrasted with what has been previously stated.\n* Air Tati: To understand the context, let us go back to John 1:1, which states, \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.\"\n* Dr. Yon: The Word is Jesus Christ, who is God and was in the beginning with God.\n* Air Tati: We also look at John 1:14, which says, \"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.\"\n* Dr. Yon: John 1:12 explains what it means to believe in Jesus, stating that to believe is to receive him, and that this is an active choice that must be made.\n\n**Dr. Yon's Personal Experience**\n\nAir Tati: Dr. Yon, I'd like to share my personal experience as a Jew who did not initially receive Jesus, but later came to believe in him and became a child of God.\n\n**Connecting John 1:12 to Acts 18**\n\nDr. Yon: John 1:12 is connected to Acts 18, where Jesus tells his disciples that they will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon them, and they will be witnesses to him in Jerusalem, Judea, and to the ends of the earth.\n\n**Exploring John 3:16**\n\nDr. Yon: Now, let us turn to John 3:16, which begins with the word \"for.\" The word \"for\" in this verse is used to clarify or explain something that has been previously stated.\n\n**Understanding John 3:16**\n\n* Air Tati: To understand the context of John 3:16, let us go back to John 3:1, which introduces a conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus, a Pharisee.\n* Dr. Yon: Jesus tells Nicodemus that he must be born again to see the kingdom of God, and Nicodemus is puzzled by this statement.\n* Dr. Yon: Jesus explains that being born again means being born of the Spirit, and that this is necessary to enter the kingdom of God.\n* Air Tati: We also look at Numbers 21:4-9, which tells the story of the Israelites being bitten by fiery serpents in the wilderness and being healed by looking at a bronze serpent that Moses lifted up.\n* Dr. Yon: Just as the Israelites had to look at the bronze serpent to be healed, people must look to Jesus to be saved.\n\n**The Parallel between John 3:16 and the Story of the Bronze Serpent**\n\nDr. Yon: We draw a parallel between the story of the bronze serpent and John 3:16, noting that just as the Israelites had to look at the bronze serpent to be healed, people must look to Jesus to be saved.\n\n**The Importance of Faith and the Simplicity of the Gospel Message**\n\nAir Tati: The episode concludes with a discussion of the importance of faith and the simplicity of the gospel message, as well as an invitation for viewers to examine their own beliefs and consider the promise of eternal life through faith in Jesus Christ.\n\n**Key Points and Concepts Discusssed**\n\n* The importance of making observations when reading the Bible\n* The identity of Jesus as the Word and God\n* The concept of being born again and its necessity for entering the kingdom of God\n* The parallel between the story of the bronze serpent in

She points out that even if the Chinese government owns 30% of a property, they will still have a significant amount of control.\n\n### Military Installations in Arizona at Risk\n\nSome of the key military installations in Arizona that could be affected by Chinese land ownership include:\n* Luke Air Force Base\n* Yuma proving ground\n* Goldwater bombing range\n* Fort Wuka, the Army's intelligence training center in southern Arizona\n* A training area in northern Arizona\n\n### Larger Patterns of Action by Governor Hobbs\n\nSenator Rogers also mentions that the veto is part of a larger pattern of Governor Hobbs' actions, which she believes are harmful to the state. She notes that the governor has vetoed many bills, including one that would have required hospitals to track the cost of treating illegal aliens.\n\n### Potential Override of the Veto\n\nThe senator is optimistic that the veto can be overridden, and she plans to work with her colleagues to make that happen. She also mentions that US Congressman Andy Biggs is running to replace Governor Hobbs, which she sees as a positive development.\n\n### Key Points from Senator Rogers' Conversation\n\n* The importance of preventing Chinese ownership of land near military bases\n* The need for the legislature to work together to override the governor's veto\n* The potential consequences of allowing Chinese ownership of land in Arizona, including the risk of espionage and other security threats\n* The role of Governor Hobbs in vetoing bills, including Senate Bill 1109\n* The potential for Congressman Andy Biggs to replace Governor Hobbs and take a stronger stance on issues related to national security and Chinese ownership of land in Arizona\n\n### Contact with Senator Rogers\n\nSenator Rogers can be followed on her website, [wendyrogers.org](http://wendyrogers.org), and on X, where she has over 400,000 followers. She encourages people to follow her and stay up-to-date on the latest developments in Arizona politics.\n\n### REAKTION I GAZA- KONFLIKTEN: \"L\u00e4karsystemet har systematiskt raserats\"\n\nJudging Freedom\n\nDr. Fose Sidwa, en amerikansk traumatiker och intensivv\u00e5rdssk\u00f6tare fr\u00e5n Stockton, Kalifornien, vittnade inf\u00f6r F\u00f6renta Nationernas s\u00e4kerhetsr\u00e5d i New York om sina erfarenheter som volont\u00e4r i Gaza-omr\u00e5det.
