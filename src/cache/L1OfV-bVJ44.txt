If you remember the 1960s, you might recall Sister Janine Deckers, also known as Sister Smile, the Singing Nun. In 1963, her song Dominique became a number one hit. It played on radio stations around the world. She even made an appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show. [Music] Fast forward 62 years later, gone viral on social media are the beatboxing nuns of Brazil. Sisters Marazelle Casiano and Marissa de Pao. [Music] Oh my good. Deacon Giovani Bastos joined Sister Marissa in the lively dance. These two nuns are dedicated to helping people struggling with drug addiction and they emphasize that music is a powerful tool to connect with them. Sister Marzelle stated, "Beat boxing, dancing, and the songs themselves are tools that God uses to reach the hearts of the people we work with, and it works. It's beautiful to see. Indeed, it is effective." However, I doubt Pope Leo is ready to incorporate those dance moves into Sunday mass at the Vatican. Yet, those moves remind me of what I've seen in various charismatic churches here in the US. Regardless, it is refreshing to see a contemporary approach to reaching young people for Christ worldwide. They can witness the joy of Jesus through the dance moves of these beatboxing Brazilian nuns. But it's up to us to let them know they can experience the same joy in their lives if they put their trust in him. Jesus is the reason for our faith. So whether you're in Brazil, Europe, Kenya, or Cambodia, let's remember what King David said in Psalms 95 and 150. And what Moses stated in Psalm 100, make a joyful noise. Praise him with drums and dancing. Come before him with joyful songs, knowing that the Lord is God. It is he who made us and we are his people. Yes, he is worthy of all praise. That's it today from the Global Lane. Until next time, be blessed. [Music]
