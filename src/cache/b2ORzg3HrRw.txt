I'm just grateful to the fans, you know, because we're the the show far exceeded Amazon's expectations, our expectations um you know, the finale was number one on Amazon um uh in the US and and in many countries around the world. And it's just we're in this moment of the Bible. Like it's um it's like the return of the Bible to film and television. So to have any part in that is a great privilege. And uh and I love the show. It's a it's a story I've always wanted to tell and uh I'm very proud of the work the team did on it and uh it took almost 700 people to make the show. But mostly, I just want everybody that has watched the show to know you're creating a moment for us that's unprecedented in our industry.
