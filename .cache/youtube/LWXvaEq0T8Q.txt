Well, Jen, once again, we have an interesting report to break down here. There is new research from the Pew Research Center, and they do some really wonderful research. So, it's interesting that they dove into astrology, tarot cards, and fortune tellers. And what Pew found was that 30% of Americans, about three in 10 Americans, use these things at least one time a year. Again, that's tarot cards, astrology, fortune tellers. As a former psychic medium, what was your reaction to these numbers? Oh, I thought it was it was horrific to be quite honest with you, but I can't say that I'm completely surprised. I agree that it's great that there was a study done on this to let us see what's going on. In this article, uh it went on to say that a low percentage doesn't necessarily You didn't even ask me that, Billy. I'm sorry. But, uh doesn't necessarily believe and that's a big problem. Many people are going because they think it's entertainment. But I want to argue something. As a former psychic, how sure are we that they don't believe a little bit? How do we know that when they go for that reading, it's not like, "Oh, I wonder what they're going to say or what's going to come out for me in the cards or the astrology chart." Yeah. Well, and the other thing when you're surveying people, it's like when you ask somebody, "When's the last time you gave a donation?" People will always, and I don't have the numbers in front of me, but they'll always say, "Oh, it was like last week or last month because you actually believe that, but really it might have been a year ago that you gave money." You when you're answering certain questions, you may think that the researcher will think it's silly if you say you believe, right? So, I would bet you're right. I would bet that that number on the trust factor is actually higher, which is unfortunate. Um, and you know, to to re reiterate what you said, two in 10 say that they do it mostly for fun. One in 10 Americans said that they engage mostly because they get helpful insights. So people might downplay that and say, "Oh, well, it's only one in 10, you know, people who are saying that." That's a pretty large number of people still though. I mean, right, that that are actually finding helpful insights in this information. I don't know if you want to reflect on that at all. Yeah, Val on both points that you just made. I mean, number one, whether you believe or not uh in it and you're just doing it what you believe is for entertainment, you're opening a demonic door, which is so heartbreaking. That's just the truth of it. If you're going to use a tool of divination, you're going outside of God's will and boundaries. It doesn't matter what your reasoning is for it, and then you're inviting that into your life. So, that's really heartbreaking for people that say that they're going to it for for insight, for wisdom. Hello, I did that myself. I totally understand that. And especially in such a chaotic world that we live in. And I I totally get that desire. Yet that's the desire man has had since sin came about. Satan tempted Eve in the garden, right? We want to know what we aren't supposed to know. Except that it's not true. The enemy works in halftruths, right? So, hey, let me give you a little a little something that already happened in the past and now I've got you hooked. I will report that to you accurately. Now, I've got you hooked and I'm going to start giving you all my li my other lies. And the lie is that you one of the biggest ones that you should even be going to psychics and tools of divination for your help, for your wisdom, and for your decision making. It's it's really upsetting. Well, and and the thing that people need to understand is you as a former psychic medium, you were not just a psychic for 3 months, for a year. For the majority of your life, you spent in that world from very young until you were in your late, you know, 30s. I mean, you believed this. You believed it was real. You believed you were helping people. You believed that you were connecting. You were giving them, you know, their fortunes. You believed you were connecting with the dead. You know, talk a little bit about that just so people understand because we can say all day, well, most Americans don't really think there's anything going on here. They're just doing it for fun. But as a practitioner, you actually believed very much so. And you were engaging with the spirit realm, just not the types of spirits you thought. Right. 100%. And I truly had a compassion for helping people. And I believed I had this gift from God as it was reported to me from the new age community. And I believe that because that was an explanation for what was going. Why else was I getting detailed information, not random, detailed information about random people in random places, but then also when I was doing readings on a regular basis. So I was going around anywhere I went I was followed by this multitude of demons feeding me information and using me as a pawn for the evil one. So uh that made perfect sense to me and I really did want to help people. On the flip side of it as the client I also was a client many times. I was getting readings for years of my life Billy as you know my first one was at 13 and after that I too went to divination. Even when I did my own readings I did automatic writings on myself. I channeled. I went into a meditative translike state and I channeled and it was always to ask a question to find something out about my life. So I can understand both. But the reality is that this is a very real thing. It's really demonic and blowing it off as some sort of game or entertainment uh party fun thing is a very dangerous thing to do. Well, and I think to your point earlier, there's more to it than that. Even if people are doing it for fun at a party, they think that there's some truth in it. There's something even if they think it's fun that they want to pull from it, which is why they're engaging in it. And the thing that really showed up in the research, some different groups of people, I'm just going to talk about one right now. Young adults, especially young women, they are more likely to look at astrology and horoscopes than most other groups. Why do you think young people, especially young women, are so entrapped in that when you compare them to other age groups and other individuals? You know, I wonder if it really goes back again to the garden, Billy. I mean, it was the woman who was tempted by the serpent for and hey, listen, I'm not trying to be sexist or anything here. Uh we we also have uh we have this maybe what some people want to call like this intuitive thing, this softer side, something like that where we're more prone to. And again, I I hate to generalize, but you you asked the question to uh to the spiritual realm. We're we're looking for that. I mean, there's a big thing with the divine feminine, too, with goddess worship and so on and so forth. And we have to remember that our culture today is certainly targeting that age range with the female musicians that are all I am woman, hear me roar. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and and that's a really good point. And I think women too, and I'm I'm going to say something. I'm I'm going to get myself in trouble. There are plenty of women who are logical and plenty of men who are emotional. But the point is women are more in tune to emotion in general and men tend to focus more on does that make sense? you know, the logic. And so, you need both of those things in life. And and again, men and women can have both of them. But I think that this is more emotional, right? Because it does play into your emotions, your feelings, what you want to know about the future. We all want to know what our future is, but we're not intend we're not intended to know that. We're intended to trust God uh for what he has for us and and to be in his will. Uh so, there's a lot here. I don't know if you want to reflect on that at all before I get myself. Well, we're both canceled. Don't worry. Uh actually what I would like to mention and going back to the people that uh are saying that it is just entertainment. I'd like to say I I I'm skipping over what you just said only because I wanted to get this out that what happens then you're going for fun, right? What happens the day that you're just your fun reading um comes up with something in that reading that you understand that is accurate that resonates with you and you have that oh my goodness moment that shock factor. Now, what happens, Billy? Because let's say you go nine times out of the 10, and nine times out of the 10, you're still laughing it off, but that 10th time, you hear something that hits home in a really big way and at a really vulnerable time of your life. This highlights the danger of doing something that's demonic. Again, whether you agree with it or not, but I do agree. Um, going back to what you said, absolutely, I'm with you 100% on that. Um women are more emotional, wondering about many things, things that are on the heart. Absolutely true. And yes, we do need a balance of the uh which is why men and women were created to help one another, right? And to to complement one another. You know, the other thing with young people in general outside of just females, we're watching a resurgence and an interest in faith. And we'll sort of close out with this because I think this is important. As young people are questioning the lies they've been told, they're looking for something bigger than themselves. There's this is not positive. This data is not positive. But the glimmer of hope in it is that there are people who are open, young people, to something bigger than themselves, right? That they're realizing that it's not just what's in front of us. So the goal would be how do you get them away from tarot cards, astrology, and all of that and get them towards the Lord. But do you think because we're watching so many young people start to question the secularism that we have that maybe that might be driving some of more of this unfortunately again but because they're looking for that truth. Yeah. Absolutely. And that's the ultimate spiritual battle, right? The tugofwar between uh you know quote unquote good and evil, you know, God and the enemy that we see this spiritual battle happening in the high places. Uh, and we see the enemy trying as hard as he can to influence these the youth and and the rest of people too for souls. It's it's a battle for souls. And I think that it it it's true what you're saying. It's great to see the conversions that we're seeing. We're seeing a revival. We're seeing great things, which is awesome. And this is prime time, Billy, to be warning and exposing uh about the new age and the occult. Absolutely. No. and and this is what we need to be doing and you know making sure that we're actively trying to reach people with the truth. Now I want to highlight a couple of things that you are working on right now before we go here. Uh this is very important. People can go to x psychicsave.com that's your website. You also have a podcast x psychicave that people can go and listen to your YouTube channel. And you have a big project right now um that you are fundraising for which is a film out of the shadows and ex- psychic finds Jesus a film about your life. It's an incredible story and if people want to take part in that they're able to go to your givesgo.com/outoftheshadows they can go and contribute to that if they would like and find out more information about that project. Anywhere else you want to send people Jen. Thank you Billy. I really appreciate that. I think you I think you hit uh you hit all the spots. I mean, on the website, if I'm going out and I'm speaking, I'm going into churches. Uh there's a a form that can be filled out on my website if you'd like to come have me um talk uh in your church. The new book is coming out in October, October 1st. I'm super excited. But yeah, if you guys want to support this movie uh that I'm blessed to say my brother here, Billy, is uh joining uh joining forces with me on this, it's really important to do all that we can in our culture. It's one thing that we're exposing it, right? It's another thing to get in there and say, "Okay, I'm exposing this and yet I'm also showing you the power of God, the glory of God, and how he can take somebody like me. He can take your friend, your mom, your sister, your daughter out of the new age and bring them into the kingdom of light with our Lord Jesus Christ. Well, that is a perfect perfect perfect place for us to close today. Jen Nisa, as always, thank you for your time. God bless you, Bill. Uh Billy.
