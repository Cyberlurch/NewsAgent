Crypto  czar  David  Sex,  the 
 White  House  crypto  czar,  has  now 
 tried  to  convince  JP  Morgan  CEO  Jamie  Diamond  about 
 Bitcoin.   And  Jamie 
 Diamond,  for  those  who  don't  know,  is  the 
 CEO  of  JP  Morgan  and  an  extreme 
 Bitcoin  enemy.   Yes,  he  has  already  talked  so  much 
 nonsense  about  Bitcoin  and 
 said  that  it  is  a  pyramid  scheme 
 that  is  only  for  criminals.   In 
 2017,  during  the  hype  when 
 Bitcoin  first  hit  $0,000, 
 he  even  said  that  he  would  lay 
 off,  fire  every  employee  in 
 his  company  or  his 
 bank  if  they  traded  in  Bitcoin,  because  he  saw  it  as 
 proof  of  their  stupidity 
 .   That's  what  he  said  back  then,  right?   It's 
 not  nonsense.   And  now  he, 
 crypto  czar  David  Sex,  has  tried  to 
 explain  the  topic  of  Bitcoin  to  Jamie  Diamond 
 and  explain,  hey, 
 maybe  you're  exaggerating  a 
 bit.   And  then  Jamie 
 Diamond  said  I'm  defending  their  right  to 
 buy.   Do  it.   But  he  is  simply 
 not  convinced  about  Bitcoin.   Um,  David  Seck 
 said  in  the  interview, 
 I've  already  spoken  to  him  about  it 
 and  explained  to  him  that 
 cryptocurrency  is  a  new  type  of 
 digital  asset  and  represents  a 
 fundamental  technological  breakthrough 
 ,  because  we've  never  had 
 anything  digital  that 
 can  be  scarce.   I  tried 
 to  convince  Jamie  Diamond.   Yes,  he 
 tried,  but  obviously  without 
 success.   Um,  Jamie  Diamond  says,  uh, 
 "If  I  were  the  government,  I  would 
 shut  it  down."   He  said  that  in  2023. 
 And  that  shows  once  again  his  understanding 
 of  Bitcoin.   He  really  thinks  the 
 government  could  shut  it  down.   Yes,  he  does 
 n't  understand  what  Bitcoin  is  all  about 
 and  why  Bitcoin  is  so  good.   Yes,  I 
 wish,  I  really  wish, 
 Jamie  Diamond  was  the  government  and 
 would  try  it.   That  would 
 make  it  visible  to  everyone  again. 
 Nobody  can  turn  it  off,  not  even  the 
 government.   Nobody  can 
 turn  Bitcoin  off,  yes,  but  that  just  shows 
 his  understanding  of  Bitcoin  and  that 
 also  shows  why  he  probably 
 speaks  so  negatively  about  Bitcoin,  because 
 if  he  thinks  a  government  could 
 turn  it  off,  then  I  understand 
 why  he  thinks  it  actually 
 
 has  no  value.   Yes,  and  now  there  are 
 many  who  have 
 changed  their  perspective  on  the  whole  thing 
 ,  especially  since  the 
 Bitcoin  Spot  ETFs  have  been  around.   And  that’s 
 another  funny  fun  fact  at 
 this  point.   Jamie  Diamond’s  bank,  JP 
 Morgan  is  one  of  the  authorized 
 partners  for  the  Bitcoin  Sport  ETFs.   What 
 does  that  mean?   If  Blackrock  now 
 issues  a  sports  ETF,  then  they  have  to 
 buy  Bitcoin  on  another  side.   Yes,  and 
 
 
 JP  Morgan,  among  others,  is  there  for  this  whole  process  of  collecting  the  cash  and  so  on.   This  means  that  they 
 are  completely  involved  in  this  process  of  buying 
 Bitcoin  for  the  spot  ETFs. 
 So  you  benefit  from  this  new 
 business model. 
 Um,  which  is  actually  exactly  what 
 Jamie  Diamond  would  have 
 fired  his  employees  for  back  in  2017. 
 They're  now  trading  Bitcoin,  and 
 yet  he  still  doesn't  understand  it  and  thinks 
 it's  stupid.   You  have  to 
 think  about  that.   Yes,  but  there  are 
 others  too.   For  example,  Larry  Fink,  the  CEO 
 of  Black  Rock,  who  admits 
 that  he  used  to  think  wrong  about  Bitcoin 
 .   Yes,  he  used  to  think 
 Bitcoin  was  a  bad  thing.   He 
 
 described  the  20117  as  an  index  for  money  laundering.   Yes,  and  now 
 he  sees  it  as  a  legitimate  financial  instrument.   So 
 he  says,  as  you  know,  I  was  a 
 skeptic.   I  was  a  proud  skeptic 
 and  I  studied  it,  learned  about  it  and 
 came  to  the  conclusion:  My  opinion  was 
 wrong  for  5  years.   I  believe  that 
 Bitcoin  is  legitimate.   Yes,  those  are  the 
 words  of  someone  who  has  the  courage  to 
 admit  a  mistake.   I 
 have  the  impression  that  Jamie  Diamond 
 just  doesn't  have  that  size.   Um,  in  the  end 
 it  doesn't  matter  because  at  least  he's  saying,  yes,  to 
 scroll  back  up  here, 
 I'm  defending  their  right  to 
 buy  Bitcoin.   Do  it,  right?   He  says,  "Well, 
 I  don't  think  much  of  it.  I 
 agree  with  the  nonsense,  but  you  have  a 
 right  to  buy  it.  Go  ahead.  Yes, 
 and  if  I  do  it  through  my  bank, 
 fine,  I'll  still  make  some  money." 
 Well,  you  can  think  what  you  want  about  it. 
 In  the  end,  you  see,  no  one  can 
 avoid  Bitcoin.   Even  if  he 
 hates  it  and  criticizes  it. 
 Sooner  or  later,  everyone  becomes  dependent  on  it,  which 
 makes  Bitcoin  a  kind  of  Trojan 
 horse.   even  if  Jamie  Diamond 
 thinks  it's  stupid.   Yes,  then  we  have  something  else 
 nice, 
 namely  this.   Scott  Besend 
 is  the  new  US  Treasury  Secretary  and  he 
 has  now  said  something  positive  about  the  entire 
 Bitcoin  administration  and  he 
 said  that  we  are  investing  heavily  in 
 digital  assets.   If  you'd  like, 
 I'll  let  it  run  for  a  moment,  then 
 just  listen  to  what  he 
 says  in  the  interview. 
 Priority  made  a  lot  of  these  companies 
 andush  off  what  we  want  to  do  isly 
 highest  us 
 regulatory 
 and  AML  standards  to  digital  assets 
 especially  stable  coins  and  I've  seen 
 estimates  that  just  over  the 
 Yes,  so  the  Trump  Administration  is  very  interested 
 in  the  topic  of  Bitcoin  and 
 cryptocurrency.   In  particular,  they  want  to 
 
 apply  anti-money  laundering  guidelines  to  stable  coins.   This  will  also  be 
 interesting  for  stable  coins. 
 And  that's  what  I've 
 always  said:  things  like  USDT  and 
 other  stable  coins  are  not 
 decentralized  currencies.   Yes,  they  can  be 
 controlled  centrally  and  can  also  be 
 switched  off  or  deactivated 
 .   So  in  that  sense,  everything  is 
 controllable.   um  similar  to  a 
 digital  central  bank  currency  with  the 
 difference  that  it  is  issued  by 
 private  companies.   So,  what  the  US 
 also  wants  is  to  issue  these  coins 
 ,  but  that's  why  they  have 
 introduced  this  regulation 
 that  these  coins  must  be  backed 
 by  cash  reserves,  US  dollars  or 
 US  government  bonds.   And 
 that,  of  course,  creates  a  huge 
 demand  for  US  government  bonds 
 based  on  digital  money,  to  which 
 the  American  money  laundering  guidelines 
 apply.   So  in  the  end,  it's  a 
 bit  like  a  central  bank  currency,  with 
 the  difference  that  it  doesn't 
 happen  centrally,  but  rather  there  can  be  a  variety  of 
 issuers  for  stable  coins. 
 So,  there  is  a  huge  interest 
 throughout  the  Trump  administration,  as  I 
 said,  in  Bitcoin  and  in 
 digital  assets.   And  we  should 
 get  used  to  that,  especially  in 
 the  German  media  landscape  and,  let  me 
 say,  with  all  the  German 
 journalists,  because  they 
 still  don't  do  it.   We  need  to  start 
 separating  Bitcoin  and 
 cryptoassets.   Cryptoassets  are 
 securities,  very  centrally  issued 
 crypto  values ​​ to  which 
 central  rules  can  be  applied  and  which 
 can  also  be  technically  regulated.   Bitcoin 
 is  a  commodity  in  the  eyes  of 
 Americans  and  both  are  high 
 priorities  for  Americans,  but  for 
 different  reasons.   The  German 
 journalists  who  don't  know  this 
 should  slowly  start  to 
 recognize  these  differences,  and  it's 
 really  about  time,  because  the  more  time 
 goes  on,  the  more  the 
 German  media  landscape  makes  itself 
 ridiculous  with  this  misrepresentation, 
 this  issue.   So,  we  have  this 
 .   Um  on  Truh  Social, 
 Donald  Trump  posted  two  days  ago  on  May  22nd 
 :  "Heading  to  crypto  dinner  in 
 Loden  Country,  Virginia  in  a  little 
 while.  The  USA  is  dominating  in  Crypto  Bitcoin 
 ETC  and  we  are  going  to  keep  it 
 that  way."   So  he  says  here,  we 
 dominate  crypto  and  Bitcoin  here  too. 
 Trump  makes  the  distinction  between 
 crypto  and  Bitcoin  and  so  on,  other 
 digital  assets  like  tokenized  things 
 that  aren't  built  on  crypto  networks, 
 and  he  says,  "We  are  going  to  keep 
 that  way."   So,  we  remain  the 
 dominant  force  here.   This  shows  once  again  that  there 
 is  definitely  a  lot  of  interest  in  this  topic 
 .   So,  something  positive.   In 
 Texas,  the  legislators  have  now 
 voted  for  the  Bitcoin  Reserve  and,  um,  there  is 
 now  this,  the  law, 
 this  bill  SB1,  SB21, 
 sorry,  is  also  called  the  Texas 
 Strategic  Bitcoin  Reserve  and  Act.   It 
 has  now  been  completed.   What  does 
 this  mean?   is  managed  as  a  special  fund  outside  the  state  budget 
 .   The  whole  thing  is 
 
 
 intended  to  strengthen  the  state's  fiscal  resilience  and 
 can  include  any  cryptocurrency  that  has  had 
 a  market  capitalization  of 
 at  least  $500  billion  in  the  last  12  months, 
 and  that  currently 
 only  applies  to  Bitcoin.   Why  do  you  make 
 such  laws  and  not  just  a 
 Bitcoin  law?   Quite  simply,  there  is  a 
 lot  of  lobbying  throughout  the  crypto  world 
 ,  which  also 
 influences  politics.   And  even  if  their  crypto 
 assets  don't  yet  have  a 
 market  capitalization  of  500  billion, 
 with  a  clause  like  this  they  have 
 the  theoretical  potential  to  be 
 included  in  such  a  reserve 
 ,  which  makes  them  more  likely  to 
 vote  for  such  a  reserve  and  then 
 such  a  law  will  gain  supporters  more  quickly 
 ,  right?   Whether 
 the  assets  will  be  purchased  at  all  later  on,  just 
 because  another  cryptocurrency  also  reaches  a  market  capitalization  of  500 
 billion  US  dollars, 
 is 
 another  matter, 
 but  the  point  here  is  that  one 
 
 
 can  also  collect  the  lobby  for  the  entire  crypto  market  that  has  just  been  purchased  in  order  to  get  Bitcoin  reserves  on  the 
 way.   Yes,  and  that's  how  it  was 
 passed  here,  and  that  brings 
 us  to  the  next  state,  along  with  New  Hampshire  and  Arizona, 
 where 
 something  like  this  can  now  theoretically  be  purchased, 
 i.e.  Bitcoin  and  crypto  assets  in  that 
 sense,  and  we  see  that  there  is  more 
 demand  for  this  topic.   There  are 
 also  many  states  that 
 are  against  it.   But  I  think  the  more  people 
 decide  to  do  it,  the  less  afraid 
 the  others  will  be  of 
 taking  this  first  step  and  then 
 possibly 
 
 coming  into  the  crosshairs  of  Bitcoin  critics  like  Jamie  Diamond  or 
 Elizabeth  Warren,  the 
 Democratic  politician  who  has  attacked  Bitcoin  so  strongly 
 .   It  has  now 
 been  voted  on,  yes,  by  101  to  42 
 votes,  but  the  governor  still  has  to 
 sign  it,  but  the 
 probability  is  very  high.   Texas  is 
 generally  considered  to  be  the 
 Bitcoin  state.   Yes,  there  is  a  lot  of 
 Bitcoin  mining  going  on  there,  mostly  in 
 the  USA  and  so  on.   Texas  is  very 
 open.   Therefore,  it  is  assumed 
 that  this  will  already  be  approved  by  the  governor 
 .   And  if  not,  then  it's 
 probably  only  because  there  are 
 some  details  that 
 are  still  inconsistent 
 or  missing.   By  the  way,  if  you 
 want  to  buy  Bitcoin,  check  out  the 
 21  Bitcoin  App  Austria. 
 Not  only  is  it  fully  regulated  in  Austria,  it 
 also  has  a  partnership  with 
 Deutsche  Volksbank  Reifeisenbank 
 Bayernmitte.   Bitcoin  that  you  buy  with  the 
 savings  plan  or  directly  can 
 also  be  sent  immediately  to  your  own  wallet 
 .   But  you  can  also  say, 
 and  this  is  a  big  advantage  of  this 
 app,  that  this  app  only  makes 
 a  payout 
 to  your  own  wallet  once  a  certain  amount  has  been  reached.   The 
 advantage  is  that  you 
 
 can  save  on  transaction  fees  on  the  Bitcoinnet  network.   For  example, 
 you  set  up  a  savings  plan  of  €100  a 
 month  and  tell  this  app  that  once  the 
 value  reaches  €500,  your  Bitcoin  will  be 
 paid  out  to  your  own  wallet.   Then  you 
 would  save  €100  in  Bitcoin  with  the  provider  for  5  months 
 and  as  soon  as 
 these  €500  are  full,  the 
 provider  would  automatically  transfer  these  Bitcoin 
 to  your  own  wallet.   With  the 
 Blogtrainer  code,  you  save  even  more 
 fees  from  the  provider  itself  and, 
 of  course,  support  our  work.   You  can  find  the
