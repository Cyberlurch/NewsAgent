I know it's a shocker, but Jesus is not a Christian. God is not Jewish, by the way. And by the way, Jesus never ever quoted the New Testament even once in the entire gospel. Paul never used the New Testament to preach. I'm not trying to put down any I'm just trying to tell you going to church today with only the New Testament and the Psalms is half the Bible. And I hope you paid half the price for it. Galatians 4 says, "But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth his son, born of a woman, born under the law." He was a Jew of the tribe of Judah, to redeem those who were under the law, that we say, "We that we might receive the adoption as sons." We're all adopted. You understand that in the rabbitical writings, adoption is even stronger than being born of your own mother and father. Do you know that being born to your own mother and father could be a plan thing or accident? Hello. You know something happened. You know what? But when you there is no accidental adoption. You don't live your life and accidentally you have adopted someone. To adopt someone is to choose someone as he is and to say I want him. That's the adoption that we all have.
