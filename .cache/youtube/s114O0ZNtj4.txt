Well, France just declared war on itself, a civil war of sorts. That's because some dude just punched French President Emanuel Mcronone in the face on a weekend flight to Vietnam. Who was this dude? Well, it turns out it was the first lady, Breijit Mcronone. Yes, the former school teacher who is 25 years his senior seen grabbing his face and pushing him in the face off the flight. Now, cameras caught the first couple in what can only be described as an airborne domestic disagreement while disembarking from their plane in Vietnam. The footage shows First Lady Breijit giving Emanuel Mcronone a slap punch to the face and then they come out there. You can see the same red coat that was just slapping him in the face. And uh it all started with a smack to the face and then escalated to like a two-hand maneuver over his mouth, nose, and jaw. and not in a loving like get over here you rascal way no don't kiss me you'll mess my makeup kind of way I get that all the time but that's usually just a verbal a verbal assault or I just go no honey don't don't mess me yeah I I've never actually hit him in the face no matter how much I wanted to oh okay no just kidding no we don't lay our hands on each other in that way now the French government originally tried to deny authenticity of this footage But then later they said the couple was just horsing around and joking. Now look, Breijim Mcronone is 72 years old. Emanuel Mcronone is 47. They are 25 years apart. And I think it it is worth an exercise to think about him as a 14 15year-old student while she was very close to 40. That's how their relationship began with this unhealthy power structure. I think if we if we really wanted to be generous here with an explanation is that safe to say that sometimes elderly people can get mean and aggressive and irritable due to either cognitive decline or medication. I think that would be charitable to give her the benefit of the doubt. Mcronone does not look complicit here though. I think there's no explanation under which he doesn't look like he's expecting it. He puts his arm out to her, right? He doesn't look like he is in an antagonistic conversation. He is looking at her. Her his hands are relaxed before it comes. He is clearly not joking around, not playing along. Now, here are some uncomfortable truths about the Mcron. Even if you don't want to go down the is she a man, which she has never satisfactorily explained. Uh even if you don't want to, let's put that aside for a second. Here are some facts. He was groomed by her. And I have a 14-year-old son who's almost 15. A 39year-old teacher comes near him. We're going to have some problems. You're going to get mama bear over this. So again, 14 is when their relationship began. They lied about it. Initially told the press he was 17, only to back that up later and admit. So again, the relationship began under power imbalanced, ethically fraught conditions. This behavior begs the uncomfortable question. Has he been abused since he was 14? Is this symbolic of what has always been since he was a child? Here are some other uncomfortable questions. Again, they have never satisfactorily proven that she is a woman. Never produced images before her 30s. Never produced images of her pregnant. Never explained why there was a brother that was not explained for in her family pictures. why AI matches that to her face. They have never answered for the fact that despite these looming questions, was he groomed by a pedarast? In the very first presidential portrait of Emanuel Mcronone in 2017, the works of Andre Ged, an avowed pedarast was in the presidential portrait. Does that happen by accident? Do you accidentally have pedophile pedophile literature on the desk when you take your presidential portrait? In what world could that be accidental? And again, the fact that when they originally uh explained their relationship, they said he was 17, he was not, he was 14. Um, and again, the age of consent in France is is different than it is in the United States. So, let's just for as an exercise, you know, think about if Mcronone was a woman, was groomed at the age of 14, and then hit in public, would we feel very differently? It's a very uncomfortable thing to confront and even harder to ignore, wouldn't you say, Clayton? Yes, absolutely. And I think, you know, Candace Owens, people pointing out in the chat, Candace Owen has has all the all the uh all the deets on this. Yes, she did a deep dive. Of course, she broke this broke the story wide open from the French journalist who originally reported all of this. The pedarass book in the official French portrait like that doesn't just wind up there by accident. It's too big of a of a question. It's like the Balencil It's like the Balenciaga stuff like how does pedophilia stuff get get put into Balencil? Balenciaga. Can never say it right. Yeah. How into their ads. Like it's intentional that you're putting this in your photos. things just you would have to think right be okay people are wondering am I a victim of a pedarast I will say nothing but there is this imagery in my first portrait it's like a public cry for help right and so you might think he's not a great world leader it's very hard to feel sorry for him you know but is has he been a victim of this when you look at the fact that he's not an especially accomplished academic he they had to change academic standards for for uh tests that he failed. Why is he in this position of power? Is was he put there by some kind of dark sex ring? Right? So again, that it's so hard. It it's not nothing and we can't we can't pretend that it is. We should not play along with the French government that this is just horsey jokey. It absolutely is not. Uh, and this person again was the victim of a grooming relationship. There's there's no I mean there's no other explanation for it. So, let us know how you feel about that. All right. Uh, well, ladies and gentlemen, there's a war happening right now.

And by the way, this comes like a few weeks after the whole cocaine in a bag on the Ukrainian train scandal. Right. Right. We're like, "Oh, let me just hide the hide the little spoon for the cocaine and just put that bag in my pocket. You need to see all that." Now, I originally had put some information and asked Chat GPT like can we say that this may be aggressive elderly behavior like grandpa gets mean and chat GPT said Breie Mcronone is a woman and I was like I didn't ask about that at all. I'm asking about the aggression. Wait a she's not a He says Breie Mcronone is a woman and I was like I didn't ask. I'm asking about this power dynamic. Clearly, she groomed him. Whether she's a she or a he doesn't it almost doesn't matter. And Chat TBT apologized to me like you're right. I was just heading you off the conspiracy theories. Can I just tell you like almost all weekend not only David you I got in arguments with Chat GBT and and some different AI programs because it's like again it's garbage in garbage out. So whoever's programming these things, right? I mean obviously the programming is that yes, Breijit Mcronone is a woman, right? Someone had to have put that in there. Yeah. And then you're presenting evidence that the opposite, right? And finally, and I love that the AI is like, "Oh, you know what? You're right." All the time. That's why it's Yeah. It's replacing my need to argue with my husband because I can argue with AI and prove that I'm right and it apologizes very readily and then I don't have to continue to be mad because we have a joke in our house that one of us can get over an argument right away and the other one, guilty party, takes five to seven business days. Uh because I get over an argument. That's how I roll. I'm a woman. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's how quickly, you know, you just get off. Uh yeah, another good question. Adrienne wants to know, you know, what was the should what was on the shoulder of the woman in the yellow vest redacted. So, we analyzed that and it turns out, first of all, that woman was not on the flight. Um she got she was outside of the door when it opened and it looks like a bloody shoulder. Can we rerun that video, Philip, if you have it, of the flight attendant who's like out, it looks like she's outside of the ground standing on the outside when they open the door. So, if she was in fact hurt, see, watch her walk down and it does look like a bloody shoulder, but in other images, it looks like a scarf. Uh, what if she was in fact hurt? She was not in fact on the plane. It doesn't seem like she was hurt by either of them. See, watch her walk down and you see her shoulder does look strange. Yeah. But you can see the scarf moving. You know, it's like a little scarf like underneath um underneath like her like where her hair, but that like vest that she's wearing, it's kind of like pinched down underneath her her vest and you can see it kind of like flapping as she moves. So yeah, but she wasn't really on the flight. But a lot of people like why is she bloody? Why is a Stewart is bloody have a bloody shoulder? Right. And she doesn't look like she saw very much because she was on the other side of the door. It's the cameras that caught it. The the rest of the people on the outside of the plane were unawares clearly.
