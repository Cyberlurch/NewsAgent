Friends, we have to talk about a nuclear crisis that nobody seems to be talking about. And this is a very, very big deal. Now, when you talk about the people who are really, really in the know, like people who are running the government, they know this. But people out here like you and I, we're not talking about this. And uh well, part of it is that we can't really do anything about it. But this is a major situation. bear country out there, the place that's fighting with Eastern Europe has uh the world in a really tight spot and it has to new nuc with nuclear fuel. We're talking about uranium uh and uh the export ban that they have on their their uranium is desperately needed in the United States. There's a reason why some in the government are already panicking. President Trump has issued emergency orders that are just starting to be acted on. It seems like it's too little, too late. Let's talk about it. Welcome to the Popular Report. I'm Steve Popppler. I'm an accountant by trade. And these are the things the mainstream media just won't talk about. Go ahead, Google it. Google the uranium shortage. Um there's some people investing in uranium because they they see the shortage there. Uh but when you talk about like what is happening with uh with with just that nuclear power plants are going to run out of fuel, nobody's talking about it. Now to give you some concept concept of like how big of a deal this is. About 18.6% of the US electricity in 2023 were generated using nuclear power plants. Uh when you look at other countries like France and some other nuclear powers, they use quite a few electric generators that run on uranium. Now, China has been building uh nuclear power plants like like it's going out of style. India is trying to build as many nuclear power plants as they can. Uh but it's going to take some time for them to kind of catch up. But we got all this happening, but we need to get back to where does the uranium come from? Back in the day, the United States used to mine quite a bit of uranium, but nowadays most of it comes from bricks and brick friendly countries. How much so? Well, let's see here. 43% of the world's uranium happens to be mined in Kazakhstan. And if you're like, "Is that brricsalign?" Yes. Yes, that is bricxeline. That's like Russia light. Okay. Kazakhstan is so deeply imshed with the CIS that it's basically Russia. Okay. Um Kazakhstan 43%. Now bear country itself is uh 5%. And then China is 3%. So you roll all that together and you're looking at 58% of the world's uranium is uh mined in bricks or bricks aligned countries. Now there's some other countries that have pretty sizable holdings. Uh Canada mines about 14%. Namibia, a country you think about so very often, 11%. Now, they're kind of aligned with France and France kind of has them in their pocket. But if somebody were to come along like China or Russia and uh to kind of sway them into their new sphere of influence, that's 11%. It goes from 58% controlled to 69% controlled. That's kind of a big deal there. So, you can see how this is not so good. Now, how much does the United States produce of the world's uranium? United States uh produces.15%. That's not 15%. That's not even 1.5%. We're talking 0.15%. A fraction so small, the only reason they show up on the list is because it's the United States. And of course, the United States needs to show up on the list. Even if we manu we uh produce about 75 tons of uranium ore uh last year and the year before that it was an embarrassing like 25 tons. So 0.05% the previous year. Absolutely ridiculous. Now, just to give you a sense of that, um, we produce approximately 0.4% of the uranium that we need to run our reactors, which in a perfect world where we're all just trading resources around freely and there's no massive sanctions against any countries, that would not be a serious problem. But the United States decided to sanction Russia and to put on them a bunch of um export controls. So basically the United States is not allowed to import any uranium from bear country unless unless the United States issues a waiver to which country looked at the United States and says if you want to ban our our uranium that's fine we'll ban exporting our uranium to you. So there's no waiverss we don't have to play those games because that's exactly what was going to happen. is just kind of like we're just going to keep issuing waiverss. We're going to do this uh social posturing like we're okay, we're sanctioning them and then we just kind of have a bunch of uh waiverss to kind of make make it so that's not a problem. Well, Bear Country is like no, if if you're gonna do it, let's do it. Yeah. Just because just because Bear Country uh you know well you said 5% right they they they make 5% of the world's uranium u produce it. Yeah but bear country enriches about 40%. Oh where does all that Kazak uranium go? Most of it goes into Russia. Yeah, that's basically what happens. The remaining uh uranium or where does that go? Goes to China. China produces about 17% of the world's uh enriched uranium because they got all those nuclear power plants down there. And they're kind of stockpiling that that as well. They got to power their nuclear power plants because I mean that's the only way you can make plutonium which you need for your nuclear weapons program which China is rapidly ramping up but that's a whole another topic. China building nuclear weapons while the United States has nuclear weapons that are like 40 years old. Yeah. If we were to go out to a Patriot missile battery where we have nuclear weapons that are going to lift off, fly all the way around the world and land somewhere in bear country or China or someone else and go Kabooi. They've been sitting in their silos for 40 years now. give you some idea of what we're talking about here. I'm about 40 years old and uh everything with me doesn't work anymore and I have been sitting in a silo for that many years now. I know they pulled them out of the silos, they refurbished them, and they changed some of the gizmos on them and stuff like that, but still, when you have an airframe, particularly a singleuse rocket that is 40 years old, there's bound to be some problems. Yeah, our nuclear weapons are old. We're not talking about the Ohio ballistic missile submarines. That was a whole another video I did a while back. But um the fact that one of our legs are nuclear triad depends on uh technology that we developed in the uh 60s and 70s with the nuclear missile submarines is another topic. Um anyway, the problem is that Bear Country, who makes 40% of the world's enriched uranium, won't let the United States import any of that. And China is also not letting the United States import any of its enriched uranium. So where exactly is the United States going to get all this enriched uranium in order to, you know, run our nuclear power plants? And if you're like, "Well, Steve, we're going to be dependent upon the Europeans." And yeah, I know you're you're you're thinking the same thing I am, which is that doesn't sound like a good plan. We're dependent upon the Canadians and the Europeans. Now, we're not directly related uh dependent on the Canadians. Uh basically, the Canadians ship that mostly over to Europe. Europe enriches it and then Yeah. Anyway, so all that gets spat back out and the United States has to import the uranium to run about 18.6% of our power grid. Now go back a few years to 2019 and it was at 20%. We've been kind of losing some of the u capacity, nuclear capacity in the United States and uh we've been building other power plants and stuff like that as the needs of our grid have expanded. But just round it off to 20% of our power grid is reliant upon a fuel that we don't have here in the United States. Now, it's not that we can't mine it. We used to mine it and we could mine it again, but there's this environmental regulation stupid agency out there and they're just like their qualification for a new uranium mine is no, doesn't matter. No, we're just not doing that. Just think about how they respond to like a new oil well, which is like probably no, and we're going to have to find a way to say no to you. When it's a uranium mine, it's just like no, but we're going to make it take as long as possible. These environmental studies for a potential uranium mine would usually take years and years and usually come back with a no. We just had the fastest approval environmental approval assessment for a new uranium mine ever out in Utah. The U environmental review was fasttracked. Uh they were ordered to uh make a decision within two weeks, 14 days. They came back within 11 days and approved the mine. That's pretty efficient. Now, they're reopening uh an old uranium mine and then they're opening up a new uranium mine uh as part of that project, that joint project. Uh now, currently we have three uranium mines open inside the United States, but they're pretty small. Uh this will actually be fairly you know when in full production it'll be bigger than the three mines that we have operating currently which some years we're producing 25 metric tons or not metric tons 25 tons real tons of uh uranium ore uh compared to you know 75 in 2023 who knows what it is each year. Uh but the fact that uh that's so small of a number that we have to start using decimal points in our percentages uh should tell you how little uranium that the United States is really producing. It's mission critical. We need to have our own uran uranium supply for our nuclearpowered submarines, our nuclearpowered aircraft carriers. Yeah, we need we need a little bit for that. And then we also need them for our nuclear weapons. We need them for our nuclear power plants, but we don't seem to be producing any uranium. And that is a missionritical item. So, President Trump has fasttracked the uh the production of of this mine, the uh environmental clearances and everything like that. The Trump administration realizes how over a barrel we truly are when it comes to uranium. bear country. China have closed their grip around the uranium supply and if they can swing Namibia uh away from the French, we're going to have even more problems. Now, the French have been all in on nuclear power. They they they make like 80 80 plus% of their power grid is nuclear power. Uh they they've been all in on that. Japan used to be kind of all in and then Fukushima happened. Uh, Fukushima was like a 1960s plant or something like that. It was a super old plant um, built by the Americans and the Americans came in repeatedly and said, "One, you're not keeping it up to the 1960s standard. Uh, you failed to keep these backups operational." And then they were just like, "But the backups cost money, you know, and so they just didn't do the backups." They're like, "Ah, we don't really need them. There's already there's already so much redundancy in the system." And then then this giant tidal wave hit the power plant and knocked out the backup generators. And everyone said, "Where's the backup to the backups?" And everyone and the answer was, "We haven't kept them up because that would cost money." Well, what's the plan for if the backup generators uh get impacted and we've already shut down the main reactors? Like what what then? And the answer was we don't know. And given that they were super old reactors, they just, you know, they didn't have some of the containment features, they didn't have uh uh any of the passive backups that uh that they do nowadays. It was just a whole mess. Uh the Japanese did not upkeep their nuclear power plant. It was an old design and just one thing after the next happened. Uh that's kind of the thing that just doesn't happen with modern reactors anymore. Um and then the idea that you actually keep up the backups is important as well. And they just overlooked the potential for a tidal wave. They had a tidal wave wall. It's just it wasn't Godzilla sized, okay? And the tidal wave went over the wall and that just messed up everybody's day and destroyed a whole prefecture of uh of Japan. Anyway, uh so they they've kind of moved away from nuclear power, but they're starting to slowly move back in that direction again. We'll see if they actually build any nuclear power plants, but they've stopped shutting them down. So there's a movement there. Nuclear power is a wonderful thing. Uh as long as you don't mess it up, right? If you mess it up, then that's that's not good. Uh but it's absolutely missionritical that us and our allies and our partners have the nuclear fuel that we need. And the fact that the bricks and allies have cornered so much of the nuclear fuel in the world and u the United States and our allies just refuse to build these mines and build these uh enrichment facilities is a big big problem. A national security threat that hopefully we're going to start fixing. Back in the day the United States was the largest producer of uranium ore. Not anymore. Not anymore. Environmental protection agency has protected us into oblivion. Now we need to fix that. All right, friends. Nobody else is talking about this, but u I'm talking about it here. That's something that's going to be changed around. Uh Australia is still producing a fair amount of uranium, which is good for them. uh they don't really use all that much, but um I know we've imported some from them, but we need to really ramp up the United States production and uh encourage our allies to do the same uh so that we can get to where we need to go faster. All right, friends. Thanks so much for joining with us. If you want to check out another video from this this channel, there's one right up there. I'll see you over there or I'll see you guys later.
