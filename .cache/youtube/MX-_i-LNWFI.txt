This is a little off the beaten path from what you and I have been discussing and usually discuss, but it's so absurd and typical of the Trump administration. We have to run it. This is Christy Gnome, the uh Secretary of Homeland Security trying to explain a clause of the Constitution which school children can explain at Chris number 16. So, Secretary Gnome, what is habius corpus? Well, habius corpus is a constitutional right that the president has to be able to remove people from this country, suspend their rights. Let me let me stop the math. Habius corpus, excuse me, that's that's incorrect. Corpus, excuse me. Habius corpus is the legal principle that requires that the government provide a public reason for detaining and imprisoning people. If not for that protection, the government could simply arrest people, including American citizens, and hold them indefinitely for no reason. Habius corpus is the foundational right that separates free societies like America, from police states like North Korea. As a senator from the live free or die state, this matters a lot to me and my constituents and to all Americans. So, Secretary Gnome, do you support the core protection that habius corpus provides that the government must provide a public reason in order to detain and imprison someone? Yeah, I support habius corpus. I also recognize that the president of the United States has the authority under the Constitution to decide if it should be suspended or not. Let's be clear though, it has never been done without approval of Congress. Even Abraham Lincoln got retroactive approval from Congress. I it's really very sad that the person in charge of deportations doesn't understand the basic law of the land which in large measure governs deportations. The right to a hearing before punishment or expulsion is imposed. Wow. That was absolutely incredible. That was basically turning a a right, a liberty which all Americans should benefit from, turning it on its head to make it a prerogative of the president of the United States to not observe it. It's just absolutely incredible. This woman is an idiot. And of course, she's a she killed her dog, didn't she, back in home. And she did, which was a story for a while. That explains it. Wow. All right, Phil. God love you, my my friend. Thank you very much. Thanks for letting me pick your brain, even going a little off uh the beaten path path to expose you to this idiot. You know, she appear You'll get a kick out of this. She's rather voluuptuous the way she dresses at times. She visited this uh this horrific prison in El Salvador where the guys are stripped to their waist. They're wearing shorts and sneakers and socks and they're barechested. And she stood in front of them and took pictures of herself with all these guys behind bars behind her. And Max Blumenthal said, "That's prison porn." Leave it to Max. Max, you nailed it. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you, Phil. We'll see you again next week. All the best. Okay. Take care. Bye. Bye. Bye.
