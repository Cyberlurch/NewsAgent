Accusing the Jewish people of killing Christ isn't just anti-Semitic, it's biblically ignorant. Yes, you heard that right. And I'm going to show you exactly why. Let's break this down and see what the Bible really says about Jesus's death. First, did you know that Jesus actually prophesied his own death? Not just once, but multiple times. He knew it was his mission. Take a look at Mark 10:45 where Jesus said, "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many." He wasn't caught off guard. This was the plan all along. The alternative view would believe that God just improvised the world's salvation story as time passed. You tell me what makes more sense. In fact, Jesus was so committed to his divine plan that he actually rebuked Peter for trying to prevent his crucifixion. Remember that powerful moment? Peter said, "Far beat it from you, Lord. This shall not happen to you." Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan. You are an offense to me, for you're not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men." Matthew 16:22-23. This shows us that Jesus's death wasn't just something that happened to him. It was his deliberate choice to fulfill God's plan. Another important point to remember is who carried out the crucifixion? It was the Roman authorities. Even if some Jewish leaders were involved, Jesus himself did not blame the Jews. Do you remember that he said on the cross, "Father, forgive them for they do not know what they do." Luke 23:34. So even if you do believe that it is the fault of the Jews, guess what? If you want to be a Christ follower, you have to follow in his steps and forgive them. Consider this. Paul, who knew exactly what happened to Jesus and was himself initially a persecutor of believers, never tells us to give up on the Jews or blame them. In fact, it's quite the opposite. In Romans 9:3-4, Paul wrote something absolutely extraordinary. For I could wish that I myself were a cursed from Christ for my brethren, my countrymen according to the flesh, who are Israelites. Think about that. Paul was saying he would be willing to give up his own salvation if it meant the Jewish people would come to know their Messiah. Does that sound like someone who believes God's heart is to have vengeance on the Jews? Of course not. This is the heart of someone who understands God's love and plan for his people. Let's go to the heart of the matter. Focusing on who killed Jesus. Making that question the primary issue misses the whole point of the gospel. It's not about blame. It's about salvation. Look at what the writer of the book of Hebrews states in Hebrews 12:2. Looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. It was a matter of his decision to go through with the cross. Difficult, you bet. Costly more than we will ever realize, but nevertheless, it was his, the Messiah's decision. Now, if God's plan of salvation required the physical reality of his Messiah being crucified, who would you expect to be involved? The Romans and the Jews were the main groups Jesus interacted with during his ministry. Think about this logically. Jesus spent his entire earthly ministry primarily among the Jewish people. Do you know what he said in Matthew 15:24? I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. Think about it. Would you expect this to happen through aliens, through California hipsters, through some random tribe in the Amazon? Of course not. The events had to unfold where Jesus was ministering in Judea among the Jewish people and under Roman authority. This is so important to understand. Jesus's death was part of God's plan from day one. Listen to what the Bible says in Acts 2:23. Him being delivered by the determined purpose and for knowledge of God, you have taken by lawless hands have crucified and put to death. It wasn't a cosmic accident or a plan gone wrong. It was God's rescue mission for humanity. This ties directly into ancient prophecies. When Jesus quoted Psalm 118 22-23, saying, "The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone." This was the Lord's doing. It is marvelous in our eyes. This wasn't just a poetic phrase. It was a prophecy about the Messiah being rejected by his own people. And in Daniel 9:26, we read that Messiah shall be cut off, but not for himself. These prophecies pointed to a categorical rejection of the Messiah and his sacrificial death. It had to happen this way to fulfill God's word. Let's get back to the heart of the matter. Why did Jesus die? Look at what it says in Isaiah 53:5. But he was wounded for our transgressions. He was bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement for our peace was upon him. And by his stripes, we are healed. It's not about blame. It's about healing and reconciliation. Let me be clear. To blame any group for Jesus's death is to misunderstand his entire mission. And if you really love to point fingers, I have great news for you. You can point one directly at yourself. We're all responsible. Listen to what Paul wrote in Romans 3:23. For all have sinned and fell short of the glory of God. It was our sin, all of humanity's that necessitated Christ's sacrifice. So remember, accusing anyone of killing Jesus misses the whole point of his mission. It fails to grasp God's love, Christ's willing sacrifice, and our universal need for redemption. Instead, let's celebrate the transformative power of the gospel, the forgiveness God offers, and our call to share this good news with everyone, regardless of their background. That's what it's all about.
