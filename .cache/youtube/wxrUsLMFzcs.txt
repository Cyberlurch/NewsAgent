According  to  a  new  survey  from  Sveriges  Radio 
 Indikator  opinion,  the  Moderates  have  lost 
 a  lot  of  support.   But  which  parties  will  take  a 
 piece  of  their  pie?   Welcome  Jakob 
 Hagnell.   Thank  you  very  much  Rebecca.   Yes,  we 
 can  state  here  that  Christersson  has  to 
 settle  for  a  small  punch  roll 
 here  at  the  same  time  as,  yes,  hat  that  we  have. 
 I'm  almost  forgetting 
 the  name  here.   That's  a  bad  sign.   However,  she  is 
 not  into  rock.   But  Anna  Karin 
 Hatt  and  Jimmie  Åkesson  have  every  reason 
 to  celebrate.   Then  there  is  actually 
 also  Magna  Lina  Andersson  who 
 continues  to  strongly  influence  public  opinion.   But  it 
 is  these  two  parties  that  one  can 
 suspect  have  actually  taken  a  fair 
 share  of  the  pie.   We've  talked 
 about  the  hat  before.   Do  you  think  it  is  still  visible 
 here?   The  hat  effect  is  this  kind  of 
 misery  we're  going  to  have  to  endure  for  like  nine  more 
 months  and  it's  going  to  be  like  this  and 
 she's  so  amazing  because  she's  not 
 Moharren  Demirok.   Oh,  now 
 things  are  happening.   I  definitely  think  we're  seeing  a  certain 
 honeymoon  because  Moharren  Demirok  was  lousy. 
 That's  the 
 worst  kind  of  direction  we've  ever  seen  in 
 party  leadership  politics.   Even  Janko 
 Saboni  emerged  as  a  political  rising 
 star,  comparing  himself  to  Moharrem  de 
 Mirok.   She  was  pushing  out  the 
 party,  her  party  and  the  Riksdag,  the 
 Liberals.   Now  I  can  barely  talk  here 
 because  I'm  getting  like  this.   So  unfortunately  I  think 
 we  will  see  a  couple  of  polls  now  that 
 people  will  talk  about  the  fantastic 
 hat  effect  because  now  they  have  kind  of  said  like 
 this,  yes  we  are  going  to  make  our  own  food  in 
 Sweden  instead  of  saying  like  this  we  are  going  to  bring 
 30  million  people  from 
 Bangladesh  to  Sweden  and  then 
 you  will  probably  still  see  some  movements  towards  the 
 Center  Party  and  think  like  this,  eh  because  she 
 has,  she  has  said  like  this  that  we  should 
 not  have  anything  to  do  with  the  SD.   You 
 continue  with  this  rather 
 incomprehensible  Anne  Lövlinjen  and  then  the 
 door  stops  at  Glent.   Now  it's  true  that 
 Anna  Karin  Hatt  gives  an  illusion  of 
 some  form  of  middle  classness,  which 
 I  actually  think  a  lot  of 
 center  voters  enjoy.   But  now  you  should 
 also  keep  in  mind  that  the  Center  Party  is 
 now  the  largest  party  to  be  counted 
 as  the  communist  party,  the  Left  Party, 
 these  green  environmental  communists,  and  then  the 
 Social  Democrats,  that  approximately 
 70-80%  of  their  voters  identify 
 as  red-green.   So  I  think  we'll 
 probably  see  that,  uh,  when  she  starts  to 
 get  into  this  political  reality  of 
 where  the  center  should  position  itself,  then 
 we'll  probably  see  that  it's  starting  to  become 
 significantly  harder  to  handle.   And 
 you're  talking  about  a  kind  of  fight  here 
 between  the  Center  Party  and,  uh,  the 
 Sweden  Democrats.   But  now  Jimmy 
 Ockson  has  got  a  big  cake  here.   Why  is 
 it  going  so  well?   Yes,  the  Sweden  Democrats 
 
 actually  had  quite  a  tough  time  in  the  polls  this  spring.   It  was  a  pretty 
 big  crash  and  you  could  say  it  hasn't  gone  very 
 well.   Erm  and  that  and  a 
 lot  can  be  said  like  this,  that  the 
 immigration  issue  has  lost  its  importance  as  an 
 important  issue  among  voters,  or  so  it  is  claimed 
 anyway.   For  Sweden  Democrats 
 voters,  this  is  an  enormously  important  issue.   That 
 cannot  be  taken  away.   But  overall, 
 the  debate  has  been  about  slightly  different  things. 
 But  now  we  see  that 
 this  political  dispute  has  started  to  flare  up 
 again  between,  for  example,  the 
 Social  Democrats  and  the  Sweden  Democrats. 
 And  we  see,  for  example,  Christersson 
 who  has  had  a  very  difficult  time.   It's 
 been  a  total  dick-picking  mess  at 
 the  State  Department.   One  ambassador  is 
 dead,  another  is  arrested  after  perhaps 
 making  some  kind  of  deal  with  Sultan 
 Erdogan  in  Turkey.   And  a  third  one  that 
 would  be,  uh,  this  new 
 security  advisory  service.   Yes,  he  had 
 sent  quite  a  few  pictures  of  half-masted 
 flagpoles  or  something  like  that  on 
 various  dating  apps  for  gay 
 men.   So  it  became  impossible  for  him  to 
 leave  his  job.   So  for  Christersson 
 it  has  mostly  been  scandals  here  now.   And 
 then  he  has  felt  terribly 
 absent 
 and  Magdalena  has  no  cake  at  all.   But 
 you  say  that  things  are 
 still  going  well  for  them.   But  they  have 
 also  been  characterized  by  a  lottery  shell  and  the 
 strict  migration  policy  they  are  introducing 
 has  now  been  met  with  criticism.   When  will 
 we  see  that  it  affects  the  numbers  for  better 
 or  worse?   Yes,  the  fantastic  thing  about 
 the  Social  Democrats  still  getting  36%, 
 which  is  impressive.   Eh,  what  you  can 
 see  is  that  the  Social  Democrats  are 
 an  absolutely  fantastic  party  in  the  sense  that 
 this  is  the  only  party  in  Sweden 
 that  has  actually  gone  there  because  they  have 
 engaged in 
 electoral  fraud  in  the  election  in  Örebro  County.   uh, 
 a  little  over  a  decade  ago.   And  most 
 recently  they  went  to  the  Swedish 
 Gambling  Authority,  and  they  gave  them  a 
 penalty  of  three  million  kronor 
 for  defrauding 
 pensioners  on  lottery  tickets.   Eh,  the 
 Social  Democrats  have  long  had  a 
 very,  what  should  I  say,  forceful 
 rhetoric  about  this  and  have  talked  about 
 this  being  a  threat  to  democracy  when 
 the  parties  of  the  time  have  talked  about  wanting  to 
 limit  this  very  lucrative 
 lottery  trade.   But  you  should  bring  it  with  you 
 .   It's  about  a  threat  to 
 social  democracy,  not  Swedish 
 democracy.   Then  the  social  workers  see  it  as  the 
 same  thing,  but  it's  a  slightly  different 
 thing.   Erm,  I  don't  think  it's  the  case  that  the 
 Social  Democrats,  when  we  record 
 this  on  Wednesday,  are  having  a  congress  now.   There  have 
 started  to  be  some  voices  coming  up  and 
 kicking  these  types  of  people  like  Morgan 
 Johansson  and  Anders  Ygeman  and  Peter 
 Huldqvist,  among  others,  from  some 
 former  S-tops.   Eh,  I  think  there's 
 still  a  bit  of  civil  peace  within 
 the  social  democracy  then.   The  tendency  for 
 division  in  the  election  results  or 
 opinion  polls  is  actually  completely 
 okay.   36%  is  6%  more  than  what  was  received  in  the 
 22nd  parliamentary  election.  Erm,  but  what  you 
 can  probably  conclude  is  that  these  things 
 become  troublesome  for  Magdalena  Andersson 
 when  this  comes  up.   They  are  reminded 
 of  it,  but  we  are  not  seeing  any  significant 
 voter  movements  at  the  moment.   Then 
 they  try  to  position  themselves  towards  the  middle  in  certain 
 rhetorical  things,  like  talking  about  whether  we 
 need  to  tighten  up  immigration  and  the 
 like.   But  now  there  are 
 more  and  more  protests  against  this,  saying,  "Oh  my 
 God,  we  shouldn't 
 close  the  door  to  our  voters  who  want  to 
 come  here,  they  want  MittEuropa, 
 no  walls  are  being  built."   But  who  can  the  Social 
 Democrats  collaborate  with, 
 since  both  the  Green  Party  and  the  Center  Party  are 
 showing  slightly  different  colors  now?   Yes.   Yes,  it's 
 natural  that  there  are 
 communists  in  the  Left  Party  and  that's  what 
 this  is  about,  and  the  problem  they  have 
 now  is  that  you  have  some 
 old  communists,  left-wing  socialists,  and  then 
 you  have  Palestinian  activists  who  go 
 around  gaping  and  screaming  and  fighting  in  the 
 city.   That  is  what  forms  the  basis 
 for  the  Left  Party  and  I  think  it  is 
 completely  boiling  there  now.   Nori  [  __  ]  Star 
 has  started  a  pressure  cooker  and  I 
 think  this  is  how  the  lid  is  almost  wobbling 
 now  that  people  will  be  furious. 
 The  Left  Party  will  be 
 super  exciting  and  we'll  see  here  now  whether  Norsi 
 is  challenged  or  not  by  the 
 Palestinian  Left,  who  has  moved 
 up  the  positions  in  their  party.   It  is 
 the  Left  Party,  the  Green  Party  and  the 
 Center  Party  that  are  her  support 
 somewhere.   Ehm,  and  this  is  where  it  will 
 get  very  interesting.   The  Center  Party,  which  is 
 advancing  this 
 policy  that  is  still  ultra-liberal  in  many  ways, 
 is  largely  left-wing  in  terms  of 
 values.   Eh,  there's  no 
 problem  with  these  parties.   But 
 this  ultra-liberal  thing,  for  example  An 
 Karin  Hatt,  wants  to  continue  with  eh 
 profits  in  school  and  the  like.   This  is 
 one  of  the  things  Magdalena  Andersson  has 
 come  out  and  said  we  shouldn't  have  this. 
 We're  going  to  start  plugging  up  these,  uh, 
 welfare  gains  and  the  like.   It 
 is  something  the  Left  Party  abhors.   And 
 this  is  becoming  a  reality.   How  are 
 they  going  to  pull  this  off?   For  the 
 Löfven  government's  eight  years  in  power, 
 it  was  bordered  by  government  crises, 
 ministers  who  had  to  resign,  and  general 
 chaos  in  many  ways.   And  many 
 analysts  are  probably  quite  surprised  that 
 it  has  remained  relatively  stable  over  time. 
 Now  it's  actually  the  case  that  it's  the 
 moderates  that  have  been  the  ones,  yes  the  liberals 
 have  of  course  been  the  ones  who  have 
 
 But  in  the  Moderates,  there  has  been  a 
 sudden  defection  of  the  Foreign  Minister, 
 for  example,  Billström,  who  left 
 bang  boom,  and  now  these  latest 
 dickpick  scandals  and  the  like,  that  have 
 caused  a  lot  of  trouble.   Eh, 
 but  the  Liberals  are  the  ones  who,  during 
 this  term,  are  being  blamed  for  the  most, 
 perhaps  quite  controversial,  defections. 
 Quite  large  parts  of 
 the  parliamentary  group  have  left.   Eh,  and 
 now  the  fact  is  that  another 
 person  disappears,  then  it's  the  old  Army  of 
 Lovers  Dominikan  who  enters  the 
 Riksdag.   And  I  don't  think  the 
 liberals  want  that,  they  brought  her  along 
 because  they  thought  it  would  bring  in  some  votes. 
 But  I  don't  think  they  want  one  in 
 parliament.   No  offense  to  them,  just  a  nod 
 like  that.   That's  not  what  I  want  to  say. 
 But  they  are  a  party  in  free  fall. 
 Thank  you  very  much  Jakob  Hagnell.   Thank  you  so 
 much  Rebecca. 
 And  thank  you  for  watching  Rix.
