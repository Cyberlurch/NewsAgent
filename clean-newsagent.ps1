.SYNOPSIS
    Safely cleans transcript caches for NewsAgent
.DESCRIPTION
    This script removes only the raw transcript files (*.txt) in:
      â€¢ src/cache/
    It preserves:
      â€¢ Translation cache
      â€¢ Summaries
      â€¢ Groq and yt-dlp metadata
    Use this before a new run if you want fresh transcripts from YouTube.
